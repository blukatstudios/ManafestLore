This file contains a list of locations found in the Europan ruins for the
purpose of map design.

  Fueling Station
A station that supplied vehicles with fuel derived from dragon bones
now serves as a graveyard to the trains, automobiles, and aircraft
left at the location after the fuel reserves were destroyed. 
The massive spills of dragon fuel are largely responsible for the 
monsters found around the Europan wastes.

  Resort
Four towering hotels with luxury pools between them. One of the
hotels is still standing, but the remains are packed with monsters.

  Temple
An enormous structure half-collapsed in the war and littered with
dead Europan soldiers, the temple is home to monsters now.

  Super Market
A multi-level structure packed to the brim with goods in its hay
day. Months after the catastrophe, it was looted of its valuables
and inhabited by homeless Europans.

  Oasis
A small section of urban housing survived, and so was quickly
captured and walled off by a wealthy group of Europan survivors.
Though there is an abundance of unoccupied housing inside, camps
surround Oasis on multiple sides, the refugees inside working in order
to save up the price of entry.

  Gaul headquarters
A grouping of factories filled to the brim with monsters. The gaul
have set up camp just outside, waiting to clear the buildings in
order to settle.

  Roman trading post
Europan scavengers bring relics here to trade for food and goods
imported from Rome. A couple local farms are located here, due
to the safety the Roman soldiers provide against Spartan attacks.

  Subway station
Though its tunnels are mostly caved in, the subway station remains
intact directly beneath its surface. The NeoSpartans have begun
excavating these tunnels by hand, driven to do so by the occasional
unearthing of the remains of Europan soldiers with intact weapons.

  Water treatment plant
The facility responsible for the remaining structures with running
water, the water treatment plant is largely abandoned.

  New Sparta
Headquarters of the NeoSpartans. New Sparta hosts training grounds
for the NeoSpartans, converting food, slave labor, and scavenged
goods into supplies for the Neospartan military.

  Weapons plant
Built far beneath a block of commercial buildings, the weapons plant
is connected by partially-collapsed subway tunnels to the rest of
the industrial facilities in Europa's ruins. Loaded onto train cars
are last remaining machines responsible for supplying Europa with
its advanced weaponry. The weapons plant is home to a legion of 
orcs who have refurbished the tooling and have begun producing
weapons and ammunition. 

  Forest
Trees have grown at an unnatural pace around some of the flattened
ruins due to intervention by the fae. The resulting forest is home
to wild animals that fight on behalf of the fae that control them.

  Carthage Trade Fortress Wreck
During the war a trade fortress came in for an emergency landing. 
Despite the time since this event, Carthage has not yet launched a
recovery mission. The enormous vehicle has since become the home
of a ghoul horde whose flesh elemental seeks to power up the
portal on board and make contact with the blood realm.

  Farm Town
A small human town built from scrap where a sewage line burst during
the war. The stream of water has made this area ripe for agriculture,
and thus farmers have gathered to grow crops here. Han infiltrators
live in this town.

  Dump
Completely ignored in the war, the dump is home to piles of discarded
vehicles, gadgets, and genuine refuse. The Neo Spartans frequently
raid the dump in search of slaves or combat experience.

  Arsennal
Heavily bombed during the war, the old military arsennal is mostly
a crater and a couple basement floors. The personnel on staff moved
to Oasis, taking as much supplies as they could when they left.

Philosophy considering buildings:
-Model out the ground floor interior and balconies, where relevant.
-Make entry into the building optional.
-Determine the height of the buidling and use it for 
-Make Urban, Suburban, and rural varients of structures.


  High rise buildings
Shops on the ground floor, apartments above. These structures have loading
zones, but otherwise are devoid of parking.
