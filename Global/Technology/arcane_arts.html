<h1>Arcane Arts</h1>
The arcane arts consist of disciplines of mortal magic.

<h2>The Manum</h2>
<div>
A manum is a particle that serves as the base unit of mana. Mana passes right
through solid objects, a manum will collide with another manum.  

</div>
<h2>The Soul</h2>
<div>
A soul is a living bundle of mana. Most souls feed off the energy of a living
host. Many souls are part of a symbiotic relationship in which they provide
their host body with access to magic.
</div>
Though the soul lacks a corporeal form, it is made up of distinct parts:
<ul>
  <li>Gills-Converts ambient energy into mana.</li>
  <li>Belly-Stores latent mana.</li>
  <li>Mouth-Casts spells.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Disciplines</h2>

Spells can generally be broken down between those that effect mana
and those that effect matter. Each successive tier requires more 
raw power as well as more intricate patterns and precise positioning
of the spell matrix in order to cast effectively. As a result, it's
far more likely a magician can create flames from their hands than
form and throw fireballs(using force), or heal the damage done by
either.

<h3>Energy</h3>
Energy manipulation is simple to learn, but difficult to master. This art 
not only consists of converting between mana and non-mana energy, but also in
directing or focusing energy.

<tr>
  <th>Journeyman</th>
  <td>Frost Touch, Absorb Light</td>
<tr>
  <th>Expert</th>
  <td>Fireball, Beam</td>
</tr>
</table>

<h3>Force</h3>
Force manipulation differs from energy in that it not only requires skill to
successfully execute spells, but also the raw willpower to command the required
mana. Though brute force is adequate for simpler spells, more complex ones 
such as lockpicking require the exact application of small forces.

<table>
<tr><th colspan="2">Spells</th><tr/>

  <th>Novice</th>
  <td>Force Push, Force Pull, Levitate</td>

<tr>
  <th>Apprentice</th>
  <td>Force Lunge, Force Stab, Force Throw, Force Wall</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <th>Journeyman</th>
  <td>Force Shield, Force Flight</td>
<tr>
  <th>Expert</th>
  <td>Force Lockpick, Force Interact</td>
</tr>
</table>

<h3>Flesh</h3>
Extending one's soul into another's body, a mage can leverage energy and
force magic to heal or harm their target.

<table>
<tr><th colspan="2">Spells</th><tr/>
<tr>
  <th>Novice</th>
  <td>Berzerk, Shock</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <th>Apprentice</th>
  <td>Clot, Bleed</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <th>Journeyman</th>
  <td>Heal Limb, Heal Burn</td>
<tr>
  <th>Expert</th>
  <td>Heal</td>
</tr>
</table>

<h3>Mana</h3>
Any mage can manipulate mana from their own soul. Mana manipulation is the 
discipline of extending one's control to free mana and mana in other souls.
A soul drained completely of its mana will cease to live in the overworld, 
rendering its user magically-inert.

<table>
<tr><th colspan="2">Spells</th><tr/>
<tr>
  <th>Novice</th>
  <td>Overcharge</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <th>Apprentice</th>
  <td>Absorb Mana</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <th>Journeyman</th>
  <td>Give Mana, Soul Drain</td>
<tr>
  <th>Expert</th>
  <td>Overcast</td>
</tr>
</table>

<h3>Mind</h3>
Mind manipulation requires not only a fair deal of intelligence, but also
a greater willpower than your target. The strong-willed are immune to the mind
tricks of even the most skilled mages of lesser will.

<table>
<tr><th colspan="2">Spells</th><tr/>
<tr>
  <th>Novice</th>
  <td>Detect Mind</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <th>Apprentice</th>
  <td>Listen</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <th>Journeyman</th>
  <td>Mindspeak, Intimidate, Charm</td>
<tr>
  <th>Expert</th>
  <td>Dominate, Confound</td>
</tr>
</table>

<h3>Soul</h3>
Soul magic extends from mana manipulation to altering living souls and the 
arcane fabric of the universe itself.

<table>
<tr><th colspan="2">Spells</th><tr/>
<tr>
  <th>Novice</th>
  <td>Detect Soul</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <th>Apprentice</th>
  <td>Bind Soul, Liberate Soul</td>

<tr>
  <th>Expert</th>
  <td>Open Portal</td>
