The arcane arts is a rough description of the process by which a 
mortal soul sequesters energy from ambient mana particles, 
charges their own casting mana particles, then releases a spell.

****************
Soul anatomy
****************
To break this down, let's analyze the soul's arcane components.
Mana reserves- Where the soul stores mana charge, effects total 
mana available for magic use at any one time.

Mana gills- The portions of the soul that drain the charge from
nearby mana particles.

Caster- The innert portions of the soul that can momentarily fill
with mana whilst causing relatively little physical reaction.

Spell matrix- The formation of mana particles that, exposed to a 
burst of energy, produce a desired spell.


****************
Types of spells
****************

Spells can generally be broken down between those that effect mana
and those that effect matter. Each successive tier requires more 
raw power as well as more intricate patterns and precise positioning
of the spell matrix in order to cast effectively. As a result, it's
far more likely a magician can create flames from their hands than
form and throw fireballs(using force), or heal the damage done by
either.

Tier|Matter      |Mana magic
____|____________|__________
1   |Energy      | Mana 
2   |Force       | Mind
3   |Flesh       | Soul


****************
Energy
****************
This magic consists of transfering between mana and electro-magnetic
energy. The most common forms of energy produced are heat and light,
though strong radiation is also possible. One can also convert
energy into mana, charging spells by sunlight, fire, or occasionally
lightning. A skilled magician can pull the heat from a glass of water
, freezing it, or dissipate an incoming lightning bolt or fireball.

A common use for an unskilled energy magic is heating water or
starting fires.

****************
Force
****************
This magic involves conversions between mana and force. By creating
forces proportional or greater than gravity, mages can become 
weightless or levitate. By creating force fields and force walls, 
mages can also deflect projectiles and other physical attacks. 
Skilled mages can condense the water in air, sculpt soft materials
with incredible precision, animate objects like puppets, or
launch small items as projectiles.

By combining Energy and Force magic, one can create and launch
both fireballs and ice shards. Cooking can be done largely by
the virtues of indirectly touching and simultaneously heating
food.

****************
Flesh
****************
Manipulating organs, tissues, and occasionally individual cells of
an organism requires the finest control of Force and Energy. A minor
mistake with either can easily be fatal.

Masterful Flesh mages can seal or create openings in the skin 
and prevent blood loss by temporary holding the flow of open veins.
Such mages are often used for body modifications such as piercings,
but more often to perform bleed-less surgeries and to seal injuries.
Despite the ability to restore wounds to a non-bleeding state, pain
is not suppressed in any way.

****************
Mana
****************
This magic consists of controlling the flow of energy between mana
particles. Aptitude with this magic often shows passively through
increased power or precision behind other spells, or simply greater
rate or capacity of mana energy storage. A skilled mage can
temporarily extend their maximum mana reserve or even build a greater
charge before casting a spell, resulting in a more powerful version
of another spell.

****************
Mind
****************
The chief purpose of mental magic is to influence the souls of living
things, and in turn to influence the living things, themselves. There
are two key operations to this magic, sending and receiving signals.
A competent mental magician can identify the symbols a target uses
to make sense of the world and thus can communicate using them. An
expert mental magician further refine these symbols such that the
target cannot differentiate the thoughts their own soul is making
and the thoughts that the magician is sending to them. Though the
physical mind will reject a soul that does not align closely with
its will(thus precluding the use of direct mind control), the 
magician can warp the target's perception so that they don't realize
they are doing things they would object to.

****************
Soul
****************
Soul magic consists of altering the structures of existing souls, 
either to change their character, divide one into multiple, or
join multiple souls to become one. Expert soul magicians can bind
souls to physical structures, allowing for them to 'enchant' objects.
This can be used to preserve souls long after their bodies have
perished, or to simply provide non-magic users with magic use.
