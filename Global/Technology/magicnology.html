<h1>Magicnology</h1>
Officially known as applied magic, magicnology consists of additions
made to mundane technological epochs as well as some unique epochs
relying completely on mana.

<h4>Fae dust</h4>
<div>
Produced by grinding fae bones, fae dust is not only a potent source
of mana, but is a potent cure-all for crops. Sprinkling fae dust
onto plants heals them from damage and disease, accelerates 
their growth, and kills most parasites.
</div>

<h2>Epoch: Stone Age</h2>
Due to the limited reach of stone age technolgies, the arcane
arts replaces tech in most applications. The exceptions include
starting fires using energy manipulation or using force
manipulation to shape mud, clay, flint, or stone.

<h2>Epoch: Metal Age</h2>
The metal age opened doors to primitive arcane material science.

<h4>Dragon Bones</h4>
<div>
A benefit of expeditions to the ice realm was the availability of dragon skeletons.
The bones of dragons are so thoroughly permeated with mana that they can be
fashioned into blades or projectiles capable of damaging souls. 
Because mind and soul magic cannot penetrate through dragon bone, bone armor
and walls were developed to combat mages.
</div>

<h4>Caster Ring</h4>
<div>
Expeditions to the ice realm also led to the discovery of soul dust, a substance
that can be compressed under great heat to form spell crystals. Spell crystals 
warp the flow of mana as it passes through, much like a mage does when they cast
a spell. Though most spell crystals aren't well-enough ordered to cast a spell
when supplied with mana, a rare few do. These are affixed to rings and worn by
mages to expand their selection of spells.
</div>

<h2>Epoch: Steam Age</h2>

<h4>Mana Cell</h4>
<div>
Soul metal was discovered in the ice realm, but its application only became
apparent with the invention of the mana cell. Stuffing a small animal such as
a cricket or mouse into a small dragon bone container traps the soul of the
animal inside even after the animal's death. By driving a nail of soul metal
into the bone vessel, a mage can both store and draw mana from this cell. It is
common for mana cells to be worn as jewelry by non-mages, as the entrapped souls
will feed off the wearer's untapped mana. Charged cells are then traded for
empty cells, allowing mana to serve as a currency. In some cases human, or even
dragon souls have been captured within mana cells.
</div>

<h4>Auto caster</h4>
Connecting a mana cell to a charged spell crystal causes the crystal's spell to
cast until the cell is drained of excess mana. Using triggers to connect the
wiring of both devices allows selective casting from a single cell, though
machining of the steam age led to revolving auto casters that use multiple small
mana cells.

Arcane Material Science
***********************

The study of arcane materials has led to a wide range of
advancements not possible with mundane materials alone. What 
separates mundane and arcane materials is the manner in which the
mana particles adhere to physical substance.

****************
Known materials
****************

  Soul Sand
crystals with mana particles suspended inside them. Most soul sand
has inert mana in it, meaning it only distorts the path of mana 
energy that passes through it. Some grains of soul sand, however, 
will display magical behavior when exposed to mana energy. Though
soul sand is often found in fine grains, some naturally-occuring
sources of soul sand are as large as an acorn. Many of these larger
crystals act as a lens, focusing a source of mana energy into a 
small area, and very rarely this results in naturally-occuring spell
crystals that produce a magical spell when connected with a power 
source.

  Soul silver
A form of silver that conducts mana energy. This material is most 
often used as wiring for auto-casting devices and mana computers. 
Soul silver, however, will disperse the mana energy projected from
a magician using ranged magic. This means that spells such as 
telepathy, telekinesis, and mana drain can be hindered or prevented
by soul silver armor or walls containing soul silver dust.

  Soul Stone
A grey rock that mana cannot pass through. This is an ideal material
for weapons made to combat spirits, as one can cut and penetrate
souls using soul stone blades and projectiles. A darker use is the
construction of soul stone containers to store souls in. Provided a
hairline soul silver wire, the souls trapped inside can be be used
to temporarily store mana energy. Provided the container is 
tightly sealed, a soul fresh from a body can be stored without
significant deterioration.

****************
Components
****************

  Memory tape
Spools of this black tape store magnetic charges, allowing for the storage of
bulk data more reliable than black box computers. 

  Circuit boards
Using either the flow of mana or electricity, logic can be embedded to produce
certain outputs when given certain inputs. Two circuit boards with identical
function can range dramatically in size depending upon the manufacturer. The
main advantage of circuit boards is their output speed and reliability for
mathematical calculations when compared to black box computers

  Mana Cell
A soul trapped in a cage of soul stone with at least one soul silver
line by which mana can be pumped in or drained out of the vessel.

  Mana Crystal display
An array of spell crystals connecting to insulated 

  Mana Circuit computers
By constructing complex circuits from soul silver, a computer can
perform the same calculation reliably each and every time, provided
it has been painstakenly programmed and debugged to perform said
calculation. Circuit-based computers are most often used to
perform calculations that would be difficult to do precisely by hand.

  Collectors
A collector consits of a large tank filled with souls and two soul
silver lines. One line is wired to a large mana-draining spell crystal
whilst the other outputs mana energy to power mana devices. A collector
is a useful way to power utility devices in densly populated locations
such as cities, farms, and volcanic areas.

  Repulsors
Repulsors create and crudely direct a field of gravitational force. This can 
both push and pull effected objects.

  Memory tape
A black box computer can be programmed to read and write bumps from the
surface of a length of fiber embedded with soul metal. This tape
hosts a secondary storage of information that can outlive an
indiviudal computer and be simultaneously accessed by mutliple 
black boxes simultaneously. 

  Light pane
A matrix of tiny light-emitting spell crystals produces images of various colors
when connected to circuit boards or black box computers. Memory tape can be used
to store motion pictures for playback.

  Electrical Transducer
Spell crystals convert energy between electricity and mana.

****************
Weaponry
****************

  Caster Rings
A mage that can control their flow of mana energy can use a caster
ring. They simply charge up a burst of mana energy as they would
to cast any spell. Instead of manually casting the spell, however,
they send the mana through the ring and let the crystal inside direct
the energy in a particular structure.

  Auto-Caster Rifles/stalves/Blasters
Non-magicians use Auto-casters to combat mages. The simplest of such 
devices consists of mana cells(trapped souls), wired through a 
trigger to a spell crystal. More complex designs involve multiple
spell crystals and quick-release mana cells that can supply short
bursts of mana energy for spells such as light beams.

  Force shield
A spell crystal designed to create and shape a gravitational force field into
a shield. Simpler force shields are shaped like dinner plates, whilst more
advanced force shield use black box computers to encase the wearer in an aura
of shilding. Force fields are meant to push projectiles off course, rather than
to stop them completely. For this reason, direct hits from high-powered projectile
weapons are more likely to penetrate rather than deflect. 

****************
Technomancy
****************

  Black Box Computers
A compliant soul can be trained to perform tasks, generally
by associating inputs with outputs. Said computers can be cheaply
and quickly produced due to their simplicity, but are completely
dependent upon the competency of the soul trapped inside.

  Phylactery Suit
Some wishing to remain in the overworld long after physical death
do so by willingly trapping their healthy souls in specially designed
mana cell. Such a cell connects to an additional power source as 
well as actuators for the suit. The user can move the body at will
by directing mana energy to them.

****************
Industrial
****************

  Thermo-Mana Plant
An incineration chamber burns a variety of fuel types, converting
the heat released into mana.

  Mana Bank
A black box computer with access to an array of mana cells and 
a communicator. The mana bank buys and sells mana cells, allowing
for efficient distribution of mana amongst sparsely populated regions.

  Mana Tower
A black box computer that collects mana from nearby sources
and stores it into an array of mana cells. The Mana Tower
provides carthage with a significant amount of its mana.

  Integrity field generator
Architects can build massive structures out of cheap material by strategically
placing integrity fields within. These fields dampen or neutralize gravity, 
reducing stress on lower sections of a structure. 

****************
Communication/Information Systems
****************

  Communicators
This device consists of a spell crystal to send telepathic signals
and a spell crystal to receive them. Communicators often use patterns
of pulses that map to letters and numbers used to communicate from intelligence
to intelligence, though some communicators connected directly to circuit boards
that encode and decode messages into human-readable messages.

  The net
Joining black box computers together using communicators allows freeflow of 
information between arbitrary nodes on the network. Such a network enables the
persistence of content despite failure of individual servers. In addition to
hosting static content such as images, documents, and audio, interactive 
net worlds feature multiplayer interactive simulations. 

  Database
With training, a black box computer can be used to manage the contents
of a database.
