<h1>Mundane Technology</h1>
A wide variety of technologies rely solely upon aspects of nature devoid of 
magic. These are thus names mundane arts and sciences. Below are different
categories of technology broken up by their epochs.


<h2>Stone Age</h2>
Leveraging non-metalic materials such as bone, wood, and flint, tools were
fashioned as labor multipliers and powerful weapons against animals.

<h2>Metal age</h2>
The refining of metals such as copper and iron as well as the manufacturing
of more advanced metals such as bronze and steel allow stronger, more durable
traditional tools. Muzzle-loaded firearms become possible with these new
materials.

<h2>Steam age</h2>
The steam age is the time when machining arose to take advantage of compressed
steam and deliver a new age of industry.
