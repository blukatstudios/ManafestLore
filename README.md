# Manafest Lore
This repo contains information on factions, characters, technology/magic, and settings for use in [ManafestArena](https://github.com/blukatstudios/ManafestArena) and subsequent games. This is the source of truth for the lore to explain the internal consistency of events and places.

## SPOILER ALERT
There are no attempts at pacing the delivery of info the way a coherent narrative might. This is more along the lines of encyclopedia entries or the list of ingredients on the back of a pack of gum.

## Development
The markdown and text folders contain files of their respective types, with the .txt files containing flavor text and the markdown consisting of an enclopedic presentation of lore. The git history shows that there was once a node site to serve html templates, but these have been considered overkill for the task at hand and thus have been discarded in favor of simple markdown formatting. This repo is intended to be viewed on its github page. 

The previous approach of making an open-ended timeline with no fixed set of events will be abandoned in favor of a strict history. If the fiction laid out in this repo is transferred to another medium, it would be preferrable to take artistic license with anything that impeded said transfer.
