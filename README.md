# Manafest Lore
This repo contains information on factions, characters, technology/magic, and settings for use in [ManafestArena](https://github.com/blukatstudios/ManafestArena) and subsequent games. This is the source of truth for the lore to explain the internal consistency of events and places.

## SPOILER ALERT
There are no attempts at pacing the delivery of info the way a coherent narrative might. This is more along the lines of encyclopedia entries or the list of ingredients on the back of a pack of gum.

## Development
The markdown and text folders contain files of their respective types, with the .txt files containing flavor text and the markdown consisting of an enclopedic presentation of lore. The git history shows that there was once a node site to serve html templates, but these have been considered overkill for the task at hand and thus have been discarded in favor of simple markdown formatting. This repo is intended to be viewed on its github page. 

## Contributing to this repo

A few principles apply here.

**The inflexibile skeleton of the lore.**
There's a sequence of events that won't be changing.
1. Earth created a technological singularity.
2. The singularity created the overworld and all other realms.
3. The divine realm connected to the overworld, creating a golden age.
4. The divines left back to the divine realm, ending a golden age.

**Remaining events are possibilities.**
Just about every other event sits in a schrodinger box, making this lore
a sandbox of possibilities rather than the telling of a linear story.

**Criteria for content.**
Content works best when it hits some combination of these, in order of importance:
1. Fits seamlessly with existing laws in the universe.
2. Demonstrates some facet of the human condition.
3. Lends itself to interactive media. (ie items, abilities, factions, settings)
4. Acts as a modifier/mutator to existing content.
