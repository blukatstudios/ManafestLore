This website is a slightly fancier way to gather my thoughts than a loose bundle
of spiral bound notebooks. The contents are details about a science fiction
high fantasy universe which is intended to serve as the setting for video games.
Also, this repo is now becoming a node.js website.

Before it was a node.js site, this repo was a gathering of interlinked html 
files, and before that it was just a bunch of txt files.
