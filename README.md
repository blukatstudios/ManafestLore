# hifi-universe (AKA Manafest Lore)
This repo contains information on factions, characters, technology/magic, and settings for use in [FPS_Project](https://github.com/blukatstudios/FPS_Project) when it matures past its tech demo state and begins to accumulate content.

## SPOILER ALERT
There are no attempts at pacing the delivery of info the way a coherent narrative might. This is more along the lines of encyclopedia entries or the list of ingredients on the back of a pack of gum.

## Development
The markdown and text folders contain files of their respective types, with the text tending toward writing exercises and the markdown consisting of a enclopedic presentation of lore. The git history shows that there was once a node site to serve html templates, but these have been considered overkill for the task at hand and thus have been discarded in favor of simple markdown formatting. This repo is intended to be viewed on its github page.
