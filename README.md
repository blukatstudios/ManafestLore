#hifi-universe (AKA Manafest Lore)
This repo is a disorderly mess, but fundamentally it is a dumping place
for information on a high fantasy science fiction universe. Said universe
is intended to provide settings, characters, and items for use in the
[FPS_Project](https://github.com/blukatstudios/FPS_Project) when it matures.

#TL;DR Look at the markdown folder for latest info


# Development

Tasks:
- Make markdown versions of html files.
- Get node server to render markdown as html
- create site wrapper with navigation buttons

## Node site (server.js and templates folder)
This crude static site currently serves up HTML files without performing any formatting to speak of.
An eventual goal will be to abandon tediously editing HTML files and get the site to convert markdown
into HTML and do rendering for things like navigation buttons.

## Short writings (text folder)
These files resulted from creative writing exercises and are from the perspectives of characters in
the universe. They serve as flavor text and supplementary info.

## Markdown content
Ideally all the HTML in this repo will be converted to markdown for ease of formatting. Those files
will go here.
