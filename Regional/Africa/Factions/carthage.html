<h1>Carthage</h1>

<h1>History</h1>
<h2>Origin</h2>
Carthage grew off the back of the silver and bronze trade. Though
their population was quaint, their command over commodities made
them a major player economically and politically.

<h2>A divine trade</h2>
The introduction of divines piqued the interest of Carthage not so
much in the prospect of reliance upon divine favors, but rather
in capturing the power of the divines to use personally. Realizing
the awesome might of divine warfare and magic, the king of 
Carthage made short work of realizing their limitations.

As it was, the divines could not operate without a vast source of
mana. The difficult and unreliable nature of competing with other
divines to secure dedicated worshippers framed Carthage's entry into
the mana trade.

<h2>Profit</h2>
Carthage's royalty diverted their riches into the procurement and
study of magical resources and resources from other realms.
Steady investment in arising technologies gave rise to the mana
cell, the industrial-scale spell crystal, soul circutry, and the 
large range of inventions composed of these three elements. To begin
their mana trade, carthage distributed arcane jewelry that harvested
and stored the mana from its wearer. The wearer would wear a 
necklace, bracelet, or hair piece until the indicator light on it
changed from red to green, at which point they would exchange their
jewelry for a new piece in a Carthage store along with a small 
stipend. Naturally the trend of supplementing one's income by 
wearing fancy jewelry caught on and created a steady source of mana
with which Carthage could leverage contracts with the divines.
With the addition of wireless mana transfer, carthage almost entirely
cut their transit expenses. A network of relay stations carried 
a powerful current of mana flowing directly to storage facilities.

<h2>The Ivory Tower</h2>
Drastic measures were employed to preserve the proprietary secrets
of these technologies, resulting in Carthage's ivory tower. This
structure was built with a mana cell stashed in each of its millions
of bricks. Wired to a central power core, this tower was used as both
the central storage point as well as a headquarters for Carthage's
wealth elite. The structure, itself, was too weak to maintain its
roughly 3 miles of height. Lacking material science to create such
a structure, Carthage scientists incorporated spell crystals 
continuously casting a force partially canceling out gravity. The 
same crystals maintained an airtight seal between the bricks past the
altitude at which air thins. Rather than construct storage facilities
that could be secured by a military incursion, carthage built a
series of portals at the very top of the structure. Some portals
connected to stable realms, whilst others connected to pocket-realms
maintained by arcane machinery and a constant source of mana. 

<h2>Portal trade fleet</h2>
Using a cycle of outward-facing portals, Carthage was capable of
near-instant transportation of goods and people between distant
locations across the world. Rather than risking the possibility
of such a network to be captured and used against them, Carthage
once again invested in the same pocket-realms housing the scientists
and equipment connected to the Ivory Tower. Further security was
afforded by the construction of flying fortresses suspended in the
air by the same technology holding the Ivory Tower up. By maintaining
the fleet at regular distances, smaller flying vessels were used to
maintain shifting supply chains with with brick and mortar businesses
on the ground. Such a supply made available to the entire world 
perishable and regional resources as well as shortening the distance
of filled mana cells from the source to the Ivory tower.

<h1>Military</h1>
<div>
Carthage does not have an official military, only security teams meant to protect valuable assets.
</div>

<h2>The mechanized Core</h2>


<h1>Government and Politics</h1>

<h1>Economy</h1>
<h2>Corporate State</h2>>
<div>
Carthage's government doubles as a corporate entity. Carthage does not levy taxes
nor provide public goods. In lieu of such a model, Carthage offers a citizenship
membership with tiers of fees and awarded services. In addition to traditional
wages, Carthage often pays their employees with free or discounted services.
</div>

<h2>Carthage Communications</h2>
<div>
As a facilitator of gobal trade, Carthage invests considerable resources into
ensuring their citizens and clients can communicate with one another effectively.
</div>
<h3>C</h3>
<div>
C stands for "citizen", "carthage", or  "common". Employed anywhere official carthage business takes place, knowing C allows a citizen to any Carthage workplace
without ever needing to learn a second language. Consequently, citizens that 
achieve certifications in C are given discounts to almost all Carthagean services.
Free C classes are offered in most Carthage trade centers.
</div>
<h3>The Telepathic Network</h3>
<div>
Colloquially known as "the net", the Telepathic network is a collection of services offered via the telepathic departments of most Carthage trade centers.
</div>

<div><b>Carthage Mail</b> will send a single written or spoken message to a destination
call center, where it can then either be written and mailed or forwarded to a mobile
device. This allows nearly-instant messaging near trade centers instead of traditional snail mail that may take weeks or months to arrive from distant locations.
</div>

<div><b>Carthage Mobile</b> is a range of telepathic autocasters often called communicators that allow the user to connect to either a nearby call center or another mobile device. Owners of mobile devices often leave them on to serve
as nodes in the net in exchange for service fees. Consequently, owning a mobile
device is a source of passive income popular in most areas surrounding a trade center.</div>

<div><b>Carthage Calls</b> allow users to speak to one another through a telepathic
link hosted by professional telepaths or mobile devices. This allows real-time conference calls consisting of parties from disparate locations.</div>

<div><b>Carthage Virtual</b> is a service that utilizes a master telepath to connect the user's senses to a telepathic vision. Telepathic visions can be linked to form
virtual worlds for a multitude of purposes. These virtual worlds often function as simulations either for education, training, design, or entertainment. </div>

<div>
<b>Carthage Cast</b> is a service of on-demand visual and audio broadcasts. The cost of broadcasts are paid for largely by sponsors who pepper the broadcasts with
advertisements, allowing anyone with a visual display for their mobile device to
watch and listen for free. Due to the prohibitive cost of the necessary equipment, many places of public business will put on display multiple mobile devices playing broadcasts.
</div>

<h2>Carthage Energy</h2>
<div>
Carthage offers infrastructure to power the multitude of mana-based technologies.
</div>
<div>
<b>Carthage Credits</b>, often referred to simply as credits, are a mana-based commodity money. Utilizing the Telepathic Network, citizens can process transactions
accross the globe nearly-instantly. 
</div>
<div>
A <b>Carthage Cell</b> is a standardized, mass-produced mana cell. Carthage cells are used for most of the mana-powered devices sold by Carthage. Any empty carthage cell can be traded in for a full cell for the cost of the mana itself. The reverse is true, allowing mana collection to be a passive source of income for many citizens using special jewelry that charges attached cells with the wearer's mana.
</div>
<div>
<b>Carthage Mana banking</b> allows bulk deposit or withdrawal of mana with mana credits. Whilst trading Carthage Cells can be achieved on a small scale, mana banking
is infrastructure that enables larger mana-powered machines to operate. Mages or autocasters in a Mana Bank can supply mana to a nearby device or individual.

<h1>Culture</h1>
<h2>The Path To Acquisition</h2>
<div>
The unwritten law of Carthagean society is growth or decline. For the entrepeneurs and government workers the reality of growing a passive source of income and retiring to a life of corporate aristocracy is a real possibility. The promise of a high standard of living for the upper classes draws immigrants from all corners of the overworld to join Carthage's workforce.
</div>

<h2>Entertainment</h2>
<div>
Rich or poor, Carthage's citizens love the same forms of entertainment. Whilst the wealthy watch Casts on their personal mobile devices, the poor often huddle around any public display or file into theaters. Music echoes through the halls of almost all trade centers. Government announcements, competitions, and news programs are broadcast live on most live channels, allowing the public to be kept in the loop about matters local and foreign.
</div>

<h2>Status</h2>
<div>
Whilst most Carthage citizens aspire to be rich, none endeavor to be poor. Fancy jewelry and pristeen outfits are worn as a show of high social standing. As a rule, the less practical the outfit, the more expensive and sought after it becomes. Fashion is a moving target. In addition to fashion themes for the numerous holidays, trends are quick to come, go, and then return. It's not uncommon for the poor to purchase out-of-style outfits in hopes the style will return and raise the price of the clothing above the price paid.
