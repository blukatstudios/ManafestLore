<h1>History</h1>
<h2>Origin</h2>
The United Mahajanapadas began as a loose group of kingdoms scattered
across India. 

<h2>Divine Union</h2>
When the divines came to this region, they each adopted a kingdom of
their own. Each mortal king was endowed with powerful magic, 
transforming them into demigods of various forms. Though the divines
more often than not dealt suggestions to their new avatars, they
did insists that the kingdoms unite under shared governance. This
union saw to it that all matters between kingdoms would be solved
by discussion among kings, and if necessary, combat. This policy
ensured life and valuable resources would remain untouched by the
effects of conventional war. From the demigod kings arcane knowledge
was passed down to the locals along with lesser blessings. 

<h2>Divine exodus</h2>
When the divines left, their political structure remained. The people
were governed and protected by their demi-god kings. Though only a
small army of magicians and transformed soldiers aided in protection 
from foreign threats, the region became free from internal political
strife.
