Divine wars
The demons were born of the divine [PLACEHOLDER] in his attempts to conquer
continental Europa from the other god kings in the region. 

The Alpha demons were created as a warrior caste stronger than goblins and more 
intelligent than orcs. Advanced tactics and light magic use served as powerful 
force multipliers when combined with goblin armies. The Beta demons were created
to provide [PLACEHOLDER] with a strong supply of mana. Beta demons(or scribes) 
were created to be a weaker, but far more magically-potent variant of the Alpha 
demons. They roamed across every continent in search of souls to bind to 
[PLACEHOLDER]. When they couldn't trade souls for goods or magical services, 
they tricked, cheated, and stole.

Europan Dark Age
Though both castes served their respective roles admirably, the destruction
of [PLACEHOLDER] left the demons godless. The Beta demons leveraged this 
opportunity to directly profit from all their previous soul acquisitions and
make small fortunes off of selling magical services. 

The remaining handful of Alpha demons swore allegience to the blood god. The
demons took refuge in the blood realm. It was discovered early on that time in 
the blood realm moves far faster than that of the overworld. A new generation
of Alpha demons were trained to adulthood in only a few months of the 
overworld's time. Their goal was to spread the ghoul fever to all compatible
life and render the overworld an extension of the blood realm.
