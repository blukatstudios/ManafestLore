      History
********************************************************************************
The Beginning
Europa began as a sprawling wilderness inhabited by primitive tribes.
When the divines came, they used Europa as an arena to pit their followers
against one another. Dissatisfied with mere human followers, the divines
created new races to fight on their behalf. The goblins, demons, and orcs 
soon outnumbered humans in the region.

Enlightened Dreams
Some dreamers came from another realm to escape a civil war. They sought out
the safety through obscurity by hiding with the scattered human tribes. In 
exchange for their safety they shared their dreams of an alternative history and
its machines. The tribes gathered together and dragged themselves through an 
industrial revolution toward the hope of safety through technological 
superiority. The state of Europa was born with steel, gunpowder, and coal.

Arcane Apex
The in-fighting of divine armies halted when the humans claimed several 
strategic locations and held them against repeated attacks. From the West came
the demons, from the North the goblins, and from the East came orcs with the
common goal of crushing the human resistance. The development of repeating
rifles, artillery, and trench warfare held the borders. Dumbstruck by the
effectiveness of Europan weapons, Carthage began to trade arcane technologies
for mundane weapons.

Divine Annihilation
Europa very quickly learned to convert the energy of radioactive materials into
mana. By trading mana for supplies and more arcane technologies, Europa 
weathered the war and began development of a weapon to kill a divine with.
After the first field test of the bomb against an army of orcs, the divines
built up for an assault they would lead. A combination of divine magic and 
the detonation of severalal god-killers resulted in the destruction of both
sides. Magical beasts flocked to the ruins to bask in the area's divine fallout.
Europa and Persia blockaded their borders with Europa to keep the refugees and 
monsters from the area out. Though many Europan devices remained, their
underlying technologies were lost under the rubble of collapsed factories and 
laboratories. 

Europan Dark Age
The abundant source of mana from Europa disappeared, crippling the mana-based
industries that had grown dependent upon it. Carthage nearly collapsed from the
resulting depression. Europa's government was reborn in a walled-off section
of intact cityscape named Oasis. Though strong enough to fight off raiders and
monsters, this new Europan state was a shadow of its former self. Europa's
ruins became the home of migrant gauls, roman treasure hunters, and exhiles 
world round thanks to Carthage's portal nexus.
