      History
********************************************************************************
The Beginning
The divines came to the mainland of Europa to fight one another.
The Gnomes, Goblins, and Demons were created by divine transformation
of the native Europans for the purpose of creating races of soldiers.
The remaining humans, caught in the crossfire of divine warfare,
turned to the nearest sympathetic divines. Small warring cities 
formed, each charging tribute from their disorganized neighbors.

A Dream Of Enlightenment
From the dream realm came the dreamers, and with them ideas of worlds
entirely unknown. The humans secretly hid these dreamers in exchange
for their research. Left to their own devices and a modest budget,
the dreamers synthesized advancements gathered from their dreaming
into coherent models. A band of human scientists began work turning
these models into machines. The resulting arcane technology brought
humans from miles around. Concentrated mana milled grain, plowed 
fields, levitated bricks into place, and provided fire on demand.
The crown jewel of Europa's advancement came with the combination
of a nuclear reactor with spell crystals that converted heat to
mana. With a seemingly unending power source, the humans no longer
needed divines to hide behind.

Arcane Apex
A few of the continent's divines caught wind of this independence
and demanded the technology be destroyed and its knowledge scattered
to the winds. Boldly refusing this mandate filled the divines with
so much rage that they each formed a beast race of their own to use
as soldiers in a war to overtake the defiant human civilization.
Demons overtook Albion to the West whilst goblins and orcs moved
from the southern border to blockade Europa from Parthian assistance.
Once the borders had been neatly established, waves of attacks came
with increasing regularity. Regardless of the vast numbers of
quickly-bred goblins and mud-made orcs, Europan weapons made short
work of them.

Divine Annihilation
Europa continued to develop their military might, eventually
developing a weapon to kill the divines and end the war. Initial tests
were promising, thus leading to the development of an arsennal of
such weapons. Europa conducted a final test for this weapon. Only 
fifty years since they had sworn allegience to their divine protector
, Europa detonated a god-buster atop the alter of their host-god.
The warring gods caught wind of this, united, and launched a single
assault to end Europa once and for all and seize their
immortality-robbing weapons. The divines lead the charge and broke
through perimeter defenses. Their inhuman armies followed suit in
seemingly un-ending waves. When the divines started tearing apart
government buildings in search of the weapons, Europa's government
decided they had lost the war. In their last moments, Europa fired
their entire arsennal on the positions of the invading divines. 
The only scientists who knew to operate or create such
weapons were ultimately destroyed by them.  

Aftermath
When the ashes settled over Europa there were only godless beasts
and displaced soldiers and factory workers left to fend for
themselves. Carthage offered basic provisions in exchange for
technological goods. Once the human safe-zones were picked clean, 
carthage withdrew from the region and sat atop the new-found 
value of their arcane technology. Though migrant gauls, roman
traders, and survivors from before the war inhabited the land, 
it became a monument to the double-edged sword of technological
progress.

The Militia-
At its height,  Europa's professional military was incapable of 
providing total defensive coverage of Europan territories. Aware of
this, it provided arms to civilians. In addition to able-bodied men,
women and children soon found themselves trained to barricade
hallways and operate the mass-produced weapons they were supplied.
