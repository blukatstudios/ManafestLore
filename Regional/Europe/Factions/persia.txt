[Origin]
The Persian Empire spread NorthEast of the Mediteranian where it seized a 
permanent foothold.

[Dreamers]
The dreamers visited Persia, delivering knowledge of arcane magic in exchange
for resources and asylum from a civil war in the Dreamer realm. These dreamers
went into hiding, though the magic users multiplied as the next generations 
were taught from a young age.
