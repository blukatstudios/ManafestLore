<h1>History</h1>
<h2>Origin</h2>
The Romans were born of conquest spreading across the Mediterianian and 
southern Europe. Rome grew as corrupt as it did large.

<h2>Divine intervention</h2>
The divine conquest of Rome was short and almost welcomed due to the instability
of the existing mortal leadership.

<h2>Holy Roman Empire</h2>
Under divine rule, the unwanted of society were sacrificed in order to steal
their souls and enchant weapons and armor. These items were awarded to the most
loyal followers, giving Roman soldiers an advantage over others.

<h2>Divine Exodus</h2>
The Roman divines left willingly with the caretakers, rendering enchanted Roman 
weapons a finite, non-renewable resource. The power vaccume quickly resulted
in [Placeholder] becoming the despotic leader of Rome and punishing dissent
with exile and death.
