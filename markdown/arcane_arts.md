# Arcane Arts
Arcane mages posess the ability to form immaterial spell crystals with their souls.
As such, the arcane arts span the various effects produced by these immaterial spell crystals.

## The Manum
The manum is the base unit of measure for magical energy. Much like English feet, its scale references an entity for comparison.
In this case, a manum is the amount of magical energy contained within a single magical molecule. Mana is a non-material substance
that can be converted to and from both matter and energy. The focal point of a spell crystal catalyzes these conversions and governs the
efficiency and nature of the effect mana has on the physical world.

## The Soul

Souls are the logical conclusion of evolution taking place in the underworld, where runaway mana conversion has left no matter to form other kinds of life from.
A soul lives and breathes mana, and its metabolism demands a constant supply to prevent degrdation. Souls starved of mana long enough will wither and collapse
into their baser ethereal elements. 

Despite the immaterial nature of souls, they do demonstrate repeating structures to survive in the overworld. 
Gills convert ambient energy into mana and absorb loose mana in the air, allowing them to survive.
The belly of a soul is where it stores its reserve of mana. Lastly, the mouth of a soul is a structure that
acts as an immaterial spell crystal to focus magical energy into spells. As such, nearly all souls are capable
of arcane magic, though the souls of crickets and of humanoids vary both in intelligence and magical power.


## Disciplines

There are two major categories of arcane magic, magic that alters mana, and magic that alters energy and matter. To survive, all souls require the former, and to interact with the physical world all souls require the latter. It's as souls are capable of directing more mana and with greater precision that higher tiers of magic become available. It's also important to note that a novice mage may perform magic within all six disciplines to a very limited degree. A novice that can move a hankerchief with telepathy won't brag about it, however, and for all intents and purposes won't claim to be proficient in force magic. However, it's also worth noting that precision and shear volume of magic both impact how a particular discipline can be used. One master of force magic specializing in precision can shape clay or molten metal into intricate forms for both art and industry. Another master of force magic specializing in volume of magic can telekinetically lift stone slabs that would otherwise require a team of workers and equipment to move.

# Energy
Energy manipulation is simple to learn, but difficult to master. This art not only consists of converting between mana and non-mana energy, but also in directing or focusing energy.


**Glow**
A gentle light shines around the caster.
**Spotlight**
A focused ray of light illuminates a target.
**Beam**
A damaging ray of light burns the target.

**Absorb Light**
Rays from the sun or a nearby fire are converted to mana.

**Flaming Touch**
Intense heat forms at source of cast.
**Flame fountain**
Intense heat forms at source of cast aimed forward in a cone.

**Shocking Touch**
An elictric current is generated at the source of the cast.
**Bolt**
An arc of lightning connects from the source to the target.

**Absorb Heat**
A nearby heat source is syphoned and converted into mana.
**Freezing Touch**
Heat is converted to mana at a loss, resulting in rapid onset of cold.

# Force
Force manipulation differs from energy in that it not only requires skill to successfully execute spells, but also the raw willpower to command the required mana. Though brute force is adequate for simpler spells, more complex ones such as lockpicking require the exact application of small forces.


**Force Push**
The target receives a push away from the caster.
**Force Pull**
The target is pulled roward the caster.
**Force Bind**
The target is enclosed in a force field immobilizing it.
**Force Throw**

**Force Shield**
A rigid dome of force is created around the caster, defending from all sides.

**Force Lunge**
The caster is launched forward.
**Levitate**
The caster is lifted.
**Force Flight**
The caster does not just levitate, but freely moves through the air.

**Fine telekinesis**
The caster can perform articulate tasks such as interacting with a holo device, writing 
a letter, or picking a lock from a distance.
**Force Stab**
Force is exerted on the target in a pointed shape.

# Flesh
Extending one's soul into another's body, a mage can leverage energy and
force magic to heal or harm their target.

**Frenzy**

**Shock**
The target's pain receptors are triggered, overwhelming them.

**Clot**
A bleeding wound is sealed.

**Bleed**
An open wound is made to bleed.

**Mend Bone**
A broken bone can be set and then healed in place.

**Regenerate flesh**
Encourages rapid growth of tissue, resulting in healing of clean flesh
and exacerbation of infected tissue.


# Mana
Any mage can manipulate mana from their own soul. Mana manipulation is the discipline of extending one's control to free mana and mana in other souls. A soul drained completely of its mana will cease to live in the overworld, rendering its user magically-inert.


**Overcharge**
Mana builds in the soul past the normal capacity. Excess mana is lost when this runs out.

**Absorb Mana**
Mana is syphoned from the open air to the caster. Effective in mana-rich areas.

**Give Mana**

**Soul Drain**
Extracts mana from target to caster.

**Overcast**
Excess mana is forced through a spell matrix during a cast, resulting in an intensified spell.


# Mind
Mind manipulation requires not only a fair deal of intelligence, but also a greater willpower than your target. The strong-willed are immune to the mind tricks of even the most skilled mages of lesser will.

**Listen**
One can listen to the thoughts of a brain.

**condense vapors**
Caster condenses and cools water vapor from the air to form water droplets.
**smelt**
Caster heats an ore until it liquifies, then separates the components by weight into an ingot and slag pile.
