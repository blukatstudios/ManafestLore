# Arcane Arts
The arcane arts consist of several disciplines of mortal magic.

## The Manum

A manum is a particle that serves as the base unit of mana. Mana passes right through solid objects, a manum will collide with another manum.  


## The Soul

A soul is a living bundle of mana. Most souls feed off the energy of a living host. Many souls are part of a symbiotic relationship in which they provide their host body with access to magic.

Though the soul lacks a corporeal form, it is made up of distinct parts:

- Gills-Converts ambient energy into mana.
- Belly-Stores latent mana.
- Mouth-Casts spells.


## Disciplines

Spells can generally be broken down between those that effect mana and those that effect matter. Each successive tier requires more raw power as well as more intricate patterns and precise positioning of the spell matrix in order to cast effectively. As a result, it's far more likely a magician can create flames from their hands than form and throw fireballs(using force), or heal the damage done by either.


|Tiers|Matter magic|Mana Magic|
|---|---|---|
|1|Energy|Mana|
|2|Force|Mind|
|3|Flesh|Soul|

# Energy
Energy manipulation is simple to learn, but difficult to master. This art not only consists of converting between mana and non-mana energy, but also in directing or focusing energy.


**Glow**
A gentle light shines around the caster.
**Spotlight**
A focused ray of light illuminates a target.
**Beam**
A damaging ray of light burns the target.

**Absorb Light**

**Flaming Touch**

**Flame fountain**
Intense heat forms at source of cast aimed forward in a cone.

**Shocking Touch**
An elictric current is generated at the source of the cast.
**Bolt**
An arc of lightning connects from the source to the target.

**Absorb Heat**
A nearby heat source is syphoned and converted into mana.
**Freezing Touch**
Heat is converted to mana at a loss, resulting in rapid onset of cold.

# Force
Force manipulation differs from energy in that it not only requires skill to
successfully execute spells, but also the raw willpower to command the required
mana. Though brute force is adequate for simpler spells, more complex ones 
such as lockpicking require the exact application of small forces.


**Force Push**
The target receives a push away from the caster.
**Force Pull**
The target is pulled roward the caster.
**Force Bind**
The target is enclosed in a force field immobilizing it.
**Force Throw**

**Force Shield**
A rigid dome of force is created around the caster, defending from all sides.

**Force Lunge**
The caster is launched forward.
**Levitate**
The caster is lifted.
**Force Flight**
The caster does not just levitate, but freely moves through the air.

**Fine telekinesis**

a letter, or picking a lock from a distance.
**Force Stab**
Force is exerted on the target in a pointed shape.

# Flesh
Extending one's soul into another's body, a mage can leverage energy and
force magic to heal or harm their target.

**Frenzy**
The flight-or-fight response of the target is triggered.

**Shock**
The target's pain receptors are triggered, overwhelming them.

**Clot**
A bleeding wound is sealed.

**Bleed**
An open wound is made to bleed.

**Mend Bone**
A broken bone can be set and then healed in place.

**Regenerate flesh**
Encourages rapid growth of tissue, resulting in healing of clean flesh
and exacerbation of infected tissue.


# Mana
Any mage can manipulate mana from their own soul. Mana manipulation is the 
discipline of extending one's control to free mana and mana in other souls.
A soul drained completely of its mana will cease to live in the overworld, 
rendering its user magically-inert.


**Overcharge**
Mana builds in the soul past the normal capacity. Excess mana is lost when this runs out.

**Absorb Mana**
Mana is syphoned from the open air to the caster. Effective in mana-rich areas.

**Give Mana**
Mana is syphoned from caster to target.

**Soul Drain**
Extracts mana from target to caster.

**Overcast**
Excess mana is forced through a spell matrix during a cast, resulting in an intensified spell.


# Mind
Mind manipulation requires not only a fair deal of intelligence, but also a greater willpower than your target. The strong-willed are immune to the mind tricks of even the most skilled mages of lesser will.

**Detect Mind**

**Listen**
One can listen to the thoughts of a brain.
