# Bestiary
There are many creatures that inhabit the various realms of all shapes, sizes, intelligences, and temperments.

# Humanoids

## Human
Natives of the overworld, humans are the jack of all trades when it comes to mortal creatures. Their main advantage is their variety of viable skillsets, whilst their weakness is difficulty with which they master learned skills. 

## Gnome
The gnomes were a divine answer to starvation and a need for technological progress. A gnome can live on a small fraction of what a human can. A gnome's mind does not suffer from the difference of size, though their nimble fingers aid them greatly in fine motor skills. A gnome, however, is one dropkick from being defeated in combat. 

## BeastMan
Tribal worshippers were transformed into these creatures as a divine reward for service. Endowed with the senses, stamina, and hides of the animals they now resemble, these beast men approach their life of nomadic hunting and gathering with exceeding ease. The most common types of beast men are listed below, though the full selection created in the great plains and elsewhere is far more diverse. 

### Wolves
Formed from the marrow of social hunters, the wolf men learned to excel at chasing herds of prey across the great plains. Endowed with a mixture of endurance, strength, agility, and powerful smelling and hearing, they are excellent trackers.

### Mountain Lions
The lion men inherited a more subtle set of hunting skills. Crouched low in the grass or climbing high in the trees, they stalk their prey with natural night vision and can match their canine counterparts in hearing and detecting scents. 

### Black Bears
The bulky, heavy-framed creatures that claim ursine blood wield incredible strength and short distance maneuverability. They found great success in felling trees and hauing them distances. It's for this reason that the black bears tend the long houses that sprouted up across the great plains and forests.

### Hawks
Superior vision and the gift of flight defined the hawk men. Though flight renders hawks great hunters, it is more often utilized for trade and communication between tribes. A message sent by hawk can travel quickly over long distances, and some hawk men have managed to fly even with large satchels stuffed with goods for trade.

## Divine
Natives of the divine realm shaped by the hyper-potency of its mana. These creatures wield magic limited mostly by shear volume of mana at command. Though they often shapeshift into humanoid forms, the divines are strangers to most causes of death, and are generally only consider one another threats.

## Spirit
A being made completely of mana. When they have a living host to feed off of, they are souls and confer magical abilities. A spirit grows with age, both in size and complexity. Although technically any host with a soul has access to magic of some form, it is only the older souls that confer typical mage capabilities. 

## Alpha Demon
Moros created the alpha demons from his most loyal and skilled goblin warriors. They sent these brave men and women into the blood realm with a powerful magic to keep them from turning to ghouls or dying of natural causes. Centuries of tireless training in the blood realm spanned mere months of war in the overworld. By virtue of the aggressive training, every inch of an Alpha demon is covered in red scarring from lacerations and burns accumulated from their hellish training and only partially assaunged by divine magic. Alpha demons do not lust for violence or death, but instead only honor from their masters. Alpha demons have thick black horns on the top of their heads to differntiate them as divine soldiers. After the divines departed from the overworld the alpha demons turned their allegience to the blood god.

The average alpha demon stands roughly seven feet tall, rippled with muscles and scars from a life of combat training. Magic is a martial art for most alpha demons, with focus spent mostly on converting mana into heat in order to blast enemies with fire attacks. The most gifted demon mages wield light-bending magic to chameleon themselves with their surroundings. Other demon mages learn to open portals and capture souls to enchant with. Demons are on an unending mission to improve their merit as divine soldiers, often adopting technologies, techniques, and magics of enemies.

## Beta Demon
Often referred to as scribes, Moros transformed his most loyal philosophers, bankers, and aristocrats into the beta demons. They are short, have hooven feet, and are predisposed to powerful magics. Their use in the war on Europa was to visit villages in the overworld and use divine contracts to permanently syphon mana to their masters in exchange for petty wealth and magical favors. After the divines departed from the overworld, the beta demons continued to grow their collections of contracts, but instead leveraging the influx of mana themselves. Beta demons are held in infamy for the numerous tales of them tricking the naive and foolish into selling over their souls in misleading contracts.

## Goblin
Goblins were created as a cheap foot soldier to attack Europa. They were forged from heaps of vegetation using divine fleshcraft and large amounts of mana. Goblins are small, weak, and unintelligent. They can reproduce, unlike their Orc counterparts, and even exercise weak magic when coupled with a soul. Goblins are especially cheap soldiers for invasions, as they can be fed completely on vegetation such as moss and tree bark inedible to most humanoids. 

Though exceedingly cheap and effective with ranged weapons, goblins are nonetheless terrible at leadership roles. Most will retreat if given the chance, and the rate of goblin desserters is exceptionally high compared to other races. It's for this reason that other casts often accompany goblins wherever they are deployed, watching over them and ensuring the goblins follow their orders.

## Orc
The orcs were created as heavy infantry to support the goblins in warfare against Europa. They are transmuted into flesh from dirt and rocks using an inordinate amounts of mana and divine fleshcraft. Consequently, orcs cannot couple with souls or use arcane magic, nor do they have any ability or instinctual desire to reproduce. An added weakness of orcs is their routine need to feed on sources of mana. When supplied with mana, their bodies can use less food and heal faster. Completely cut off, however, orcs begin to deteriorate back into dirt and rocks. 

An orc is mindlessly driven toward violence, and will grow aggressive even to his own kind if not supplied with combat opportunities. For this reason large gatherings of orcs will spar to sate the desire for conflict. When denied this most basic need for catharsis, orcs have been known to go feral and fight anything they encounter.

## Ghoul
Taken by the ghoul fever, a humanoid begins to change immediately. The resulting creature quickly forms a telepathic link with fellow ghouls and offers it's thinking to a collective consciousness. The thoughts of such a collective naturally gravitate toward securing more host organisms and spreading the ghoul fever. Necromancers and strong magical entities can often overpower the will of ghoul collectives, turning them into extremely powerful armies. As the number of ghouls in a collective grows, however, overpowering the mind becomes increasingly difficult. It is not unusual for necromancers to lose control of ghoul hordes.

## Skeleton
Capable necromancers bind souls to human remains, forming skeletons. These creatures are limited to the intelligence of their spirit, which is generally gathered from creatures no more intelligent than large rats. Most skeletons, even with human souls, only vary in how they attempt to drain the nearest source of mana. This is partly due to a skeleton's main weakness: it cannot produce its own mana. This is a fact that makes skeletons ideal weapons that neither question why they are attacking, act on a sense of fear, nor outlive their usefulness for very long. Skeletons are thus the disposable armies of necromancers.

## Stone Elemental
Soul stone-based life forms that can use mana for their metabolic functions. They originate from the stone realm, which imploded long before humans arose on the overworld. Stone elements are spirits subsisting off of their soul-stone vessels. Aside from completely pulverizing a stone elemental's body into gravel or attacking their soul directly, there is no way to kill one of these creatures if confronted. Stone elementals often use nearby plants, mosses, and lichens as sources of mana.

## Fire Elemental
Energy-based life forms that convert heat to mana. Fire elementals came to the overworld long before life emerged there, and were separated from their fire realm not long after. The only way to kill a fire elemental is to either cut them off from their source of energy(often fire), or directly scatter their soul.

## Fae
Natives to the ice realm in a time when it was covered with dense vegetation, the fae claim a special relationship with the magical fauna and flora they evolved beside. Through their previous symbiosis with the ice realm, the fae developed a biological magic not reliant upon a soul(making them immune to soul-targeted technology and attacks). The magic retained after their departure to the overworld is an instinctual mastery of healing magic that allows them to repair damaged forests and accelerate the growth of healthy ones. The fae can additionally harvest mana from a variety of living sources such as foiliage. 

# Intelligent non-humanoids

## Spirit
Ephemeral natives of the underworld, spirits are often found emigrating to the overworld due to its abundance of bodies that passively collect mana. Spirits that have coupled with a physical host are often referred to as souls. A host can utilize their soul to perform arcane magic.

## Flesh Elemental
When enough ghouls gather in a hive mind, they form flesh elementals to serve as an intelligent leader. In addition to commanding ghouls, the Flesh Elemental absorbs organic matter and heals wounded ghouls.

## Dragon
Large winged reptiles from the ice realm, dragons boast intelligence alongside a compulsion to hoard valuables. In addition to flight, they have the natural ability to breathe fire using inherent magic. A dragon's blood, scales, and bones are incredibly potent alchemical ingredients as a result of their biological use of mana.

# Automata
A soul trapped inside a machine, automata cannot produce their own mana, and so slowly drain whatever supply they keep within themselves. Mana collectors are thus built into most models.

## Block Bot
Though block bots contain more parts than some of their alternatives, the shear scale of their production and ubiquity of the parts they are constructed from make construction and maintenance cheaper than small-scale builds. Thus, block bots are purchased in bulk to provide a general labor consisting of disparate skills more efficiently than specialized counterparts. Block bots generally contain a small grouping of multiple simpler computors made from smaller souls. As such, block bots are extremly useful for simple, repetitive tasks, and those that require constant work.

## Roller Bot
The roller bot's tall stature, thick plating, and powerful actuators make it the logical choice for heavy industrial and military applications. A roller bot's secondary use is entering a knealing pose so that the wheels on its shins can propel it with differential steering, allowing for carrying heavy objects with minimal opportunities for tripping.

## Weapons Bot
Designed exclusively for military purposes, the four-legged weapons bot contains a tail to mount a weapon of some form on. Though weapons bots can act individually as mobile weapons platforms, their major role is to cling to other robots and provide smart firepower. A block bot may not know the intricacies of operating a particular weapons system, but they can be very easily trained to point an arm-mounted weapons bot at a target and let deligate the task. Likewise, weapons bots can detatch from incapacitated wearers, seek out resupplied independently, and even serve as sentries. In non-military applications, weapons bots are equipped and trained with industrial tools. 

## Connector Bot
Three legs double as antennae for a powerful communications suite built into the connector bot's spherical body. The mobility of the chassis is designed specifically for climbing to, and then clinging to positions of high altitude in order to maximize effective range. In addition to merely communicating, a connector bot can direct mana from a source to particular targets in range, supporting front-line mana technology from a safe distance. The ability to synthesize input from a small fleet of Orb Bots into a single three-dimensional map is likewise invaluable for surveilance.

## Orb Bot
A sphere roughly the size of a large apple, the orb bot contains a small sensor suite, computor, and force actuator for the purpose of gathering data. Due to limited on-board computational power and mana reserve, orb bots often swarm around Connector Bots

## Phylactory Bot
The wealthiest commission a phylactory suit to contain their soul in its humanoid form, achieving extended longevity by discarding the limitations of organic life.

## Brain Bot
An option far less costly than a whole phylactory suit is a slot on a brain bot, a bipedal bot made as a vehicle for a collective of minds. Brain bots rarely move from their positions locked into connections to the telepathic network, where each soul can exist in a more meaningful form than the sinlge tendril extending from their soul stone.

# Overworld Beasts

## Bear
Will often fight or flight when sighted. When berzerked, bears are known to ignore fatal damage until their central nervous system is effected.

## Wolf
Wolves hunt in packs, and it is their clever use of numbers to surround and entrap their prey that makes them dangerous.

## Deer
Runs when approached, and can sense odors and sounds from great distances.

## Snake
Varying in size and venom potency, snakes are most dangerous because of their natural cammoflage and their quiet movement.

# Extraplanar Beasts
Creatures foreign to the overworld's ecosystems.

## Air squid
Held aloft by gas sacks and some organic magic, these creatures use their many tentacles to drag morsels of food from nooks and crannies. They mostly scavenge the dead and eat smaller animals, but can attack if provoked.

# Europan Beasts
Many creatures found not only a strange resistance to the radiation surrounding the ruins of Europa, but actively convert it to mana and again into calories. 

## Water Bear
Living in rivers and ponds near craters and vaguely resembling a bear with its plump figure, this six-legged creature chiefly subsists upon the radiation in the wastes. They are roughly the size of a small dog, can lay dormant in conditions with low radiation, and generally eat smaller plants and animals.

## Giant Crab
Giant crabs range from roughly a meter in each dimension to three. Their shells contain a mixture of heavy metals that provide the radiation shielding necessary to thrive in radiation hotspots. These shells are gained by feasting upon metal objects. Though they enjoy a rare meal, giant crabs spend the majority of their lifecycle filter-feeding radiation in a sedentary fashion.

## Giant Spider
These creatures stand roughly the same size as giant crabs, but do not have the luxury of subsisting purely off of radiation. Giant spiders dig underground nests and stack debris atop a cammoflauged trap door that they can lift in order to grab unsuspecting prey.

## Razor Swarm
The razor bug queen builds its nest in zones of lower radiation where it can process radiation more efficiently than its workers. A swarm arises when the hive detects an intruder near its nest. Razor bugs get their name from the metalic content of their chitin. Warriors in a hive have multiple barbs and sharp edges capable of drawing blood if touched by bare skin. A razor swarm will land on their target and attempt to burrow into the them. They can shred through anything softer than bronze.

## Glow Dog
As the name indicates, glow dogs produce a glow around them in any arbitrary color. Ultraviolet light is included in this glow, illuminating to the glow dog's developed eyes organic residue for tracking purposes. Semi-intelligent, glow dogs can be domesticated as guard animals.

## Land Coral
Much like giant crabs, land coral has adapted to subsist upon radiation. Unlike crabs, however, land coral is completely immobile, and is extremely aggressive towards approaching animals. Land coral has developed a sophisticated method of mimicking sounds it hears in attempts to lure creatures nearby and potentially secure nutrients it cannot synthesize from radiation. Though immobile, these creatures can extend their tentacles a couple meters out from their shells, proving dangerous to unsuspecting prey.
