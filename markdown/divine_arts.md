# Divine Arts

The divine and arcane arts seem quite similar at first glance. In both disciplines the magician uses the compoistion of their soul to channel the flow of raw mana energy into a spell. The difference, however, is that of a campfire that cooks an egg and a forge fire that turns red dust to metal ingots.



It is a common fact that divines have souls magnitudes larger than those of mortals, even when their host bodies assume the form of a human. With these larger souls comes an inexplicable increase in magical aptitude. A divine and human with the same amount of mana are capable of completely different spells. It is speculated a divine soul posesses an intelligence of performing magic efficiently and with great precision. As the density of mana energy available reaches a certain theshold, the traditional laws of mana that govern magicnology are thrown out the window. There is not merely a  mechanistic conversion between various forms of energy, but some form of intelligence is leveraged.


## Flesh Craft
A magician of health sciences can apply magic to slow bleeding, encourage healing, and even speed up the absorption of nutrients. This has built the backbone of modern health care. These are all vague, blunt, and imprecise magics that will destroy just as easily as they heal if not wielded with the utmost care. The magic to slow bleeding on an open wound can prevent death from blood loss. The same magic on a patient's head will kill them almost instantly. 



When a divine transforms a man into a monster, or turns some non-living material like dirt into a living creature, they are not blindly applying some conversion of energy. Mana energy turns to matter, but in a very specific fashion. Like a loom weaving together a fabric, this new matter is meshed together to form flesh and bone and blood and gut. It's theorized this knowledge comes not from the divine themself, but from the soul they perform with. An old soul, knowing many things well, can enable even a human to perform miracles.


## Realm Craft
The same surgical precision can be applied to non-living matter on a much larger scale. This is chiefly the process divines use to tear holes in the boundaries between realms, or to tear holes and expand new realms into existance. In this case the wise divine soul must know the essence of the univrse itself, and not merely flesh.


## Divine Contracts and curses
One better-known magic of divines is the signing of contracts that funnel mana from hosts or absorb entire souls remotely according to the terms of said contract. It's unheard of for a man to go back on a divine contract, but that's because making one requires the full cooperation of the soul. The divine only initiates contracts and inflicts pentalties or awards benefits to the souls bound by contract. Every soul abiding by a contract does so completely by its own accord, and so divines can gain an effortless source of mana in the overworld by establishing worshippers that willingly give in exchange for mercy and occasional miracles. A curse, however, is almost entirely a divine exerting their soul's will onto another. As such, it requires incredible amounts of mana to accomplish. Even still, a curse can leverage a mortal's soul to cast self-destructive spells upon its host. It's in this way marks of shame are burned onto mortals with voided contracts.
