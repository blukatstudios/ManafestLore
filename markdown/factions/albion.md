### Demonic invasion

An army of demons created by Moros arrived in Albion and fought the kingdom. The war was swift, and Albion proceeded under demonic rule.

Once conquered, the demons organized the humans of the isles into a massive slave labor force to provide agriculture, forrestry, and mining. Albion contributed legions of demons to the divine invasion of Europa in 266.
