# Albion

## History

### Formation of United Albion

Only a few years before the arrival of the divines, ports were established to accomodate Carthage trade ships. The boom in wealth in the are quickly tipped the scale of political power and the single kingdom of Albion was born with very little bloodshed.

### Demonic invasion

An army of demons created by Moros arrived in Albion and fought the kingdom. The war was swift, and Albion proceeded under demonic rule.

### Demonic Albion

Once conquered, the demons organized the humans of the isles into a massive slave labor force to provide agriculture, forrestry, and mining. Albion contributed legions of demons to the divine invasion of Europa in 266.

## Timeline

### 40: United Albion is established
Carthage trade in the region of Albion led to formation of wealth. From this wealth came a ruling class that eventually joined the region under one banner. A large source of migrants from the European mainland gave Albion a labor force to handle the raising of many cities.

### 55: United Albion invased Europe
The warring humand and goblin tribes proved dangerous to Albion, and so forces were sent out to secure the region. One by one, goblin warlords were rooted out of the area to create a peaceful mainland that provided natural resources for international trade.

### 93: Demon army invades Albion
Albion valiantly restored human control to the majority of the European mainland, leaving Moros frustrated. Rather than spread more poorly disciplined goblins and wait for them to attack Albion, Moros created the demon army to provide skilled, high-quality troops to his attack. The organized invasion of Albion was successful due to covert ops that sabotaged the region's defenses. Under demon control, all humans became slaves to the demons, who used them to produce military and industrial goods. The Europan mainland filled with human migrants, and Albion's human population dwindled under brutal working conditions.

### 274 The divine civil war starts after Albion and Europa suffer from nuclear detonations
Several warheads detonated over Albion, clearing out the land's population. Surviving demons fled to the blood realm, where they plotted an eventual return.
