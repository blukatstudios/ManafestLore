# Azteca

# Prologue

The Aztecs initially fought the divines when they came to the overworld. Once the Aztec king was dethroned by one of these divines, however, the people changed their allegience quickly. 

The god king leveraged his magic to tame the region. Obedience was rewarded with blessings. Villages that prayed frequently got consistent rain regardless of climate. Those that directly served the king were rewarded by being transformed into powerful magical beasts. The disobedient formed a slave workforce that built temples and tended fields. Noncompliance was met with immediate sacrifice.

Aztec excursions North into the continental plains brought abundant slave labor to the capital. The beast men made poor slaves, but they were nonetheless plentiful.
