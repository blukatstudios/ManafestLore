# Azteca

# Prologue

The Aztecs initially fought the divines when they came to the overworld. Once the Aztec king was dethroned by one of these divines, however, the people changed their allegience quickly. 

The god king leveraged his magic to tame the region. Obedience was rewarded with blessings. Villages that prayed frequently got consistent rain regardless of climate. Those that directly served the king were rewarded by being transformed into powerful magical beasts. 

## Beasts and Sacrifices

The Aztec god king commanded many intelligent monsters, and many more that were merely dangerous works of art. In all cases, fleshcraft was fueled by human sacrifices to provide a steady stream of mana, souls, and flesh instead of arranging direct military confrontations, the god king would have his people release a few beasts into a region and let the ensuing chaos weaken the effected entities until they were nearly helpless against the stone swords and spears raised by modest numbers of human soldiers.

Crimes were punished with sacrifice more often than not, and trials leaned on the default of guilt, rather than innocense. A constant demand for more sacrifices led to expansion across every border to capture survivors of loose beast rampages. This rendered many neutral tribal lands barren, forcing smaller populations to retreat south to Inca to avoid becoming food or sport for beasts.

## Empty throne and beastlands

For the duration of the god king's rule, the beasts were sufficiently warded off from the cities. Once the divine civil war took place, the god king was captured and brought to the divine realm, leaving a power vaccume behind. The divine magic that had created the beasts vanished, leaving only a few arcane flesh crafters to fill his shoes. This left the Aztecs in a particularly bad spot, as the god king had additionally controlled the beasts enough to prevent them from breeding. With no such control, the beasts began to create nests, lay eggs, and give live birth. Native fauna that had simply avoided the beasts soon found themselves competing with them. Aztec soldiers cleared lands adjacent to cities, but the swelling beast populations elsewhere put further pressure on non-aztec people to move into aztec cities and enjoy military protection in exchange for low wages and scarce resources.

Occasionally beast hunters and trappers brought live specimen back to the cities to study and train, leading to several varieties of domesticated beasts. Riders proved the necessary ingredient to convert many deadly beasts into weapons capable of protecting the cities and their perimeters. Before long, the aztecs began breeding and selling these beasts to the global market via Carthage. The corpses of these exotic creatures often contained artificts used in the fabrication of special items and mana technlogy.
