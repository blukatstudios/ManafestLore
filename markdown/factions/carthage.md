# Carthage


# Prologue

Carthage grew off the monopoly of the bronze trade, an asset that provided inordinate wealth. After the arrival of the divines, Carthage sent expeditions into the Ice Realm and built massive facilities where the resulting influx of arcane materials were studied and manufactured into mana devices.

Though the first sales of expensive trinkets to royalty was lucrative, it was when the divines left the overworld that the monopoly was cemented. Carthage couldn't begin to meet the demand for miracles that the divines had. Consequently, Prices were at a premium and the majority of carthage's population became involved in the mana trade, one way or another. Expeditions through Carthage-controlled portals doubled every few months, increasing in size and scale as well. Research into arcane material science rendered new applications whilst increasing the efficiency of existing ones. 



## Tech

Carthage provided "magicnology", devices that operate under the principle of a mana cell, a soul caged in dragon bone, supplying mana energy to a spell crystal to cast a spell. The effect is magic that can be used by those with neither magical knowledge nor souls.

Some popular domestic gadgets:
- Lights
- Mana cells to store mana for trade or later use
- Mana pumps that syphen latent mana into mana cells
- Mana generators that convert heat from a fire into mana
- Mana transmitters Capable of providing mana to distant targets
- Portals between positions in the overworld or between realms
- Furnaces to heat and cook with
- Computers for data storage, manipulation, and access
- Communicators for instantaneous distant communication
- Condensors to pull water from the air and provide cooling
- Levitators to lighten heavy objects and lift aircraft
- Integrity fields to reinforce buildings during emergencies(or normal operations)
- Phylactory suits capable of providing freshly deceased souls with a mechanical body


Military applications naturally followed:
- Lightning/beam/fire/force/plasma guns
- Slug throwers that fire arbitrary physical projectiles
- Force shields that deflect projectiles
- Sensors that detect nearby souls
- Blades and projectiles capable of damaging souls

## Mana as currency

Carthage ran on mana, and so it became the commodity for trade. The infeasibility of carrying mana created the minting of Mana credits, coins that could be redeemed for raw mana energy at mana banks. Credits came in multiple denominations and were relatively difficult to counterfeit due to the use of trace amounts of arcane materials unobtainable outside of certain Carthagean manufacturing processes. 

## The C Language

In addition to researching products to sell, Carthage invested heavily in the infrastructure and personnel needed to make sales. The shear number of languages made covering translation from an arbitrary language and into another incredibly difficult to achieve. As a result, C was born. 

C stands for communication, as it offered an incredibly simple vocabulary and an equally simple rule set with no exceptions in its grammar. With very few nuances, the language provided similarly few opportunities for translation. Each word of the official C dictionary was given a 3-byte integer id. As such, large bodies of text could be converted from character codes to word codes for compact storage and transmission. Carthage invested heavily in transcribing books from libraries abroad into C and making them widely available upon request via communicators.

C also stands for citizen. Carthage merchants were subject to sales taxes that formed a citizen's fund. Each citizen was entitled to either half their portion in mana credits, or investing the full amount into a grant with at least 10,000 signatures. Citizenship required an individual swear an oath to abide by Carthage laws, pay a citizenship fee (often by taking out a high-interest citizenship loan), and proving they could read and write in C. Residency, however, was not a requirement for citizenhip. This created a heavy incentive for literacy worldwide and created potential translators where none had previously existed.

C lastly stands for Carthage. Wherever the language spread, so too did credits to purchase imported goods and services from Carthage. Foreign embassies established to offer simple banking and limited trade, but often expanded into fullblown trade centers where carthagean airships made bulk deliveries.
