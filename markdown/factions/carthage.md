# Carthage

## Tech

Carthage provided "magicnology", devices that operate under the principle of a mana cell, a soul caged in dragon bone, supplying mana energy to a spell crystal to cast a spell. The effect is magic that can be used by those with neither magical knowledge nor souls.

Some popular domestic gadgets:
- Lights
- Mana cells to store mana for trade or later use
- Mana pumps that syphen latent mana into mana cells
- Mana generators that convert heat from a fire into mana
- Mana transmitters Capable of providing mana to distant targets
- Portals between positions in the overworld or between realms
- Furnaces to heat and cook with
- Computers for data storage, manipulation, and access
- Communicators for instantaneous distant communication
- A world-wide network of remote computer connections
- Displays, special communicators designed to selectively receive visual transmissions
- Cameras to record images and videos
- Microphones to record sound
- Condensors to pull water from the air and provide cooling
- Levitators to lighten heavy objects and lift aircraft
- Integrity fields to reinforce buildings during emergencies(or normal operations)
- Phylactory suits capable of providing freshly deceased souls with a mechanical body


Military applications naturally followed:
- Lightning/beam/fire/force/plasma guns
- Slug throwers that fire arbitrary physical projectiles
- Force shields that deflect projectiles
- Sensors that detect nearby souls
- Blades and projectiles capable of damaging souls

## The Portal Nexus
A network of portals were constructed across the overworld in each Carthage embassy with a hub of portals all leading to exits at Constantinople's center. This effectively destroyed traditional barriers that would prevent trade of exotic perishable goods, short-term labor, and receational travel. The overworld became flat when global supply met global demand. The economies initially involved exploded from the sudden surge of economic opportunities.

## Mana as currency
Carthage ran on mana, and so it became the commodity for trade. The infeasibility of carrying mana created the minting of Mana credits, coins that could be redeemed for raw mana energy at mana banks. Credits came in multiple denominations and were relatively difficult to counterfeit due to the use of trace amounts of arcane materials unobtainable outside of certain Carthagean manufacturing processes. 

## The C Language

In addition to researching products to sell, Carthage invested heavily in the infrastructure and personnel needed to make sales. The shear number of languages made covering translation from an arbitrary language and into another incredibly difficult to achieve. As a result, C was born. 

C stands for communication, as it offered an incredibly simple vocabulary and an equally simple rule set with no exceptions in its grammar. With very few nuances, the language provided similarly few opportunities for translation. Each word of the official C dictionary was given a 3-byte integer id. As such, large bodies of text could be converted from character codes to word codes for compact storage and transmission. Carthage invested heavily in transcribing books from libraries abroad into C and making them widely available upon request via communicators.

C also stands for citizen. Carthage merchants were subject to sales taxes that formed a citizen's fund. Each citizen was entitled to either half their portion in mana credits, or investing the full amount into a grant with at least 10,000 signatures. Citizenship required an individual swear an oath to abide by Carthage laws, pay a citizenship fee (often by taking out a high-interest citizenship loan), and proving they could read and write in C. Residency, however, was not a requirement for citizenhip. This created a heavy incentive for literacy worldwide and created potential translators where none had previously existed.

C lastly stands for Carthage. Wherever the language spread, so too did credits to purchase imported goods and services from Carthage. Foreign embassies established to offer simple banking and limited trade, but often expanded into fullblown trade centers where carthagean airships made bulk deliveries.

## The Kingdom
The king of Carthage holds absolute control over his nation, though most government functions have been contracted out to the private sector. One may make a complaint to the royal court about one of these organizations, or the kingdom itself. Spurrious lawsuits are a capital offense, and die before reaching the royal court. Once the royal court has collected information on an issue that they cannot decide on their own, they consult the king, who can ignore the code of law in his judgements. 

## Nutri-corp
A world-wide demand for cheap, nutritional food led to the founding of nutri-corp and the creation of the nutri loaf, a bread made with abundant micro nutrients. Off of the success of the nutriloaf, nutri-corp expanded their skews. Nutri-bars each provide enough nutritional content for a single meal, whilst the powdered nutriblend serves as an addative to fortify other meals that might be lacking in nutritional value. Due to the long shelf life and portability of these foods, nutri-corp secured contracting with large militaries world-wide.

## Food For Us (FFU, pronounced "few")
Moving in the opposite direction of Nutri-corp, FFU tapped an unforseen market of gormet and convenience foods, primarily supplying Carthage embassies and business centers with premium meals on foreign soil. A few candidate restaraunts participated at first to deliver global delicacies to any door within the approved radius of a portal. Demand for cheaper variants of pricy dishes led to the addition of bulk order cheaper meals. Large scale restaraunts popped up around portals in order to meet this newfound demand, and soon fresh global food became an attraction to Carthage business centers.

## Opulence Network
A series of mergers led to the cornering of Carthage's entertainment industry under the name of Opulence. Rather than encourage subsidiaries to continue producing content with independent direction, Opulence defined core demographics to appeal to, and dedicated a portion of their labor force to each. Opulence inundates every form of their media with commercial advertisements as a primary means of funding, allowing them to offer most of their content for free. This has led to increased sales of mana displays for use in restaraunts, bars, and other public meeting places world-wide.

These key demographics and their targeted content are as follows:
- Thrill-seekers : life-and-death gameshows, reality television, live documentaries
- News watchers : current events, political pundit shows, talk shows
- Kids and family : cartoons, educational programming, situational comedies

## Security, Inc
Though Carthage's king commands a royal army, its purpose is only to protect Constantinople and the region surrounding it. Foreign policing and military service are provided by Security, Inc, a company dedicated to neutralizing dangerous entities and diffusing confrontations through force. Sometimes foreign governments will shell out the cash for these protections, but more often than not Carthage investors foot this bill in exchange for a waiver of liability. This usually allows Security workers to bend or outright break many foreign laws, and to serve as a private army to break up riots, strikes, and protests in order to protect the interest of their clients.

## Thrift Central
Carthage's largest non-profit, Thrift Central uses the power of the portals to put donated second-hand goods and salvageable garbage to use and create jobs in the process. Those hired sort, organize, and repair donations or salvage discarded items at industrial centers in order to sell to other industries. Goods applicable to individuals are sold abroad at prices adjusted per region. Many owe the posession of shoes, eye glasses, clothing, or housing materials to their Thrift Central, as it services some of the more remote regions of the overworld.

## Fig
Consumer magicnology goods are sold under the Fig label and its subsidiaries. With a production line zig-zagging through portals across the cheapest locations in the overworld, the main limiting factor for production are the arcane materials and the human capital to work with them. Fig built the portal to the ice land, and it charges a hefty fee for goods crossing back to the overworld. Its consumer goods are spread world-wide, delivering every coneivable domestic gadget at a premium.

## InfoCo
InfoCo makes the majority of their income by selling the latest information they collect and organize by leveraging magicnology. InfoCo satellites make passes over most nations on a daily basis, collecting up-to-date maps and aereal images of regions that are considered secret. Governments pay monthly fees to conceal this collected information from the public, further subsidizinng its collection.

## Identity
In order to gain official Carthage citizenship, an applicant must create a profile with Identity. Identity collects citizenship dues and takes a significant cut before giving the rest to the Carthage King. Identity places kiosks with mana computers in all regions with Carthage embasies, offering locals the ability to connect to the world-wide net for a set time per day. A second source of income is the collection and sale of information in Identity profiles to governments and companies in order to inform law enforcement and advertising. Unofficial profiles are collected on individuals before they opt to create an official profile, helping for the decision of discounts or penalty fees applied to citizenship dues.

## Duet
With the overworld population linked via communicators and portals, a man in the Hann Empire could date someone living in Rome and expect to see them daily. Whilst this increased selection of partners, it did so overwhelmingly. Duet works with data collected from InfoCo and Identity in order to connect compatible singles across the overworld.

## Life LLC
The founders of Life saw great opportunities in connecting health care providers and patients of the overworld. 

From computer, patients update the health information on their Identity profiles, then request treatment within a giden date range, a user satisfaction score, prize, or within a range of preferred accepted providers. Once presented with options, they can view patient feedback for these options and then book a visit. Providers log each interaction with patients, allowing providers to both blacklist, whitelist, or adjust pricing for patients according to previous interactions. 

The net result of this two-way feedback model allowed pateints to vet their service providers and vice-versa. Access to adjust pricing via Identify profile allowed providers to artificially limit their market exposure, provide barriers for entry to patients that consistently gave poor feedback, and otherwise balance headaches with revenue.

Offering various tiers and categories of insurance, Life was able to collect premiums directly through Identity.

## Energy International
Born with the mana economy, Energy International oversees the production, storage, and distribution of mana across the globe.

## Timeline

### 0AD: Arrival of divines
When the divines came, they managed to bring no serious interest in Carthage. This was a mixed blessing in that Carthage was simultaneously overlooked when divine gifts were being handed out to the formative world powers, but Carthage did not experience any violent shift in control. The already-delayed initiation of the Punic wars had been indefinitely forestalled by the presence of powerful divine forces in Rome. Carthage, deprived of opportunities for military conquest, retooled their efforts into further economic expansion past their tin and bronze monopoly. The plan for conquest via trade was formalized and put into motion.

Carthage invested heavily in sending expeditions across the globe in the name of uncovering new resources and technologies that they could bring to market and monopolize.

### 55:  Carthage discovers ice realm
The accumulation of artifacts, specimen, and knowledge gathered from expeditions filled the great library of Carthage, where it was studied at length by every great mind available at the time. From Persia came the art of opening portals connecting distant points. It was under clinical experimentation that these techniques lead to the eventual discovery that these distant points did not need to be in the same realm. Many probes were made into various other realms, until eventually a portal opened not to the vaccuum of space or to the hazardous environment of a stellar mass or interior of a planet, but to the surface of a world with breathable air. On new year's day of 55 AD, Hamid Madani was the first man to walk in the Ice Realm.

Carthage's initial expeditions into the Ice Realm brought back little aside from ice and snow. An excavation team followed up and found dragon skeletons and fossils under the ice and soil. The mysterious material's properties proved the basis for many arcane technologies. Carthage had found their new monopoly, and so proudly brought it to the overworld. Nicknamed operation icebox, Carthage's government invested equally into both extracting resources from the ice realm and hiding its location. Careful use of portals allowed visitors to never see where dig sites sat in relation to the rest of the world. This eliminated public knowledge of the purported longitude and lattitude of dig sites. By all public accounts, the magic materials were recovered from the continent of Antarctica, and not an entirely different realm.

Carthage's mana industry began at this juncture. 

### 106: Carthage establishes airborn trade fleet
The growing industry of arcane machinery lead to a mindblowing variety of applications for a spell crystal and mana cell embedded in circuitry. The library of Carthage demonstrated the first prototype airship in 102 AD, and immediately the royal treasury commissioned the construction of more. By 106 four vessels could cross oceans, mountains, and anything in-between to distribute goods across lattitudally lines. Combined, the four vessels provided a near-daily supply of inter-continental trade. Goods were transported more reliably, and with the elimination of entire armies of middle-men traders in the regular distribution chain. Consequently, prices were reduced sharply and the entire trader's cut went to Carthage for bulk orders.

The explosion of trade led to a series of sky ports along most lattitudinal lines across the globe by which an expanded trade fleet circulated goods and passengers world-wide.

### 144: Carthage opens Opulence Network broadcasts to the world
For two hours each day, Carthage switched on the Opulence Network. Through a convoluted set of relays between sky ports, Carthage could send any telepathic signals between two arcane devices in seconds. In addition to cornering a new market of communications, Carthage wrote the next chapter in the entertainmnt industry with book films, live broadcasts, and interactive telepathic plays. Businesses world-wide competed for the two-hour broadcasting slot, and book-films were delivered with abundant commercial advertisement breaks to reduce or sometimes waive production costs.

### 290: Carthage recovers Europan nuclear technology
The fall of Europa and Albion to nuclear warfare caused a moment of silence across the world. After the initial nuclear fallout settled, several Carthagean expeditions were sent to bring survivors to safety and to prevent abandoned technological assets from falling to ruin. Many expeditions were lost as a result of arcane interactions with the residual radiation from the bombs and local wildlife. Many more expeditioners were exposed to lethal doses of radiation due to inadequate knowledge of nuclear phenomena, and did not return. The expeditions that did return brought radioactive artifacts that killed their buyers.

Despite a quarantine of Europa's wastes in 281, covert operations continued a search for the fabled nuclear power that the Europans had used to annihilate Moros. In 290, enough artifacts were recovered to reverse-engineer this technology and create the first crude nuclear reactors to power Carthage's network of arcane technologies.

Services that had run once daily were put on a 24/7 schedule, and the portal nexus was created to provide direct connections between any skyport on the globe. Dependence upon biomass and oil to produce mana shifted from Carthage to the remainder of the world, opening new markets where Carthage had previously monopolized operations.

### 292: Carthage settles Antarctica
The explosion of industry in Carthage eventually led to many of the wealthy demanding not only to expedition to Antarctica, but to settle the frigid land. In order to preserve the secrets of the Ice Realm, engineers insisted on sending ground vehicles through portals. Instead, a permanent set of portals leading to the Ice Realm was constructed. A couple palaces, and even a few larger towns were erected in "Antarctica" atop old excavation sites. The permanent portals were not only used to transfer personnel, but also thermal mass. A continual pumping of tepid and hot oils through a radiator located in the Ice Realm connected with other lines extending to the furthest reaches of the portal nexus to not only warm the Ice Realm cities, but also to cool urban homes in Carthage portal cities. This solved the problem otherwise created by arrays of heat pumps feeding exhausts into one another's intakes in crowded locations.

### 292: Carthage establishes satellite network
Portal technology eventually arrived at tackling the problem of moving portals. From this development satellites orbiting the overworled were launched and kept adrift by force motors. A portal within provided an immediate point of transfer for personnel, air, and construction materials. Consequently, the space stations ballooned from nodes in the Opulence broadcasting network into weightless palaces. Force motors soon provided simulated gravity sufficient for citizens of the overworld to pass through portals seamlessly and without disorientation.

### 295: Carthage settles Luna
Carthage's expansion to colder regions continued as portal technology grew more sophisticated. A portal to the moon was produced in late 293, and not long afterward a permanent portal was opened. Heat and air pumps solved life support issues elegantly, and Luna provided not only a conveniently distant location to pile nuclear reactors onto, but also an excellent source of solar energy. Where fears of nuclear disaster still existed in the overworld, no fear of irradiating Luna prevented expansion.
