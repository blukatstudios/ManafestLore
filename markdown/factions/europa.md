# Europa

## Pre-Europa timeline

### 0AD: Arival of divines
When the divines arrived, Moros terrorized mainland Europa with the creation of goblins. Originally, he used them as foot soldiers to subdue and collect tribute from the scattered tribes in the region. This created a flow of refugees moving to Rome, persia, and Albion to escape the goblin armies.

### 93: Demon army invades Albion
After years of turmoil, Albion sent forces to clear mainland Europe from threat of goblin warlords. With his armies broken, Moros saw to the creation of the demon army to bring Albion to heal. Albion forces on the European mainland were pushed back into Albion's main isles, where they suffered several crushing blows.

The currents of refugees reversed. Rather than face complete defeat in battle, the kingdom of Albion sent its remaining population to the mainland under guard by the remnants of the Albion military.

## Europa timeline

### 110: Europa established
With the demon army preoccupied with ruling Albion, the survivors in mainland Europe sought to rebuild quickly and securely. Trade with Carthage gave them access to an economy of scale they simply lacked, and Carthage security firms soon took interest in opportunities on the frontlines. 

In 110 the three major military bases of Europa founded a constitution and a new military campaign to retake the mainland and eventually Albion as well.

### 123: Europa retakes continent
Pushing Moros's abandoned armies North, Europa freed its plains and forests for reconstruction. Implicit in Europan architecture is provision for defense in the event of goblin or demon resurgence. The three initial Europan forts became showcases for the latest and greatest military breakthroughs Carthage had to offer. Research and development contracts opened in the region to reduce Carthage's millitary industrial footprint in its native lands. Europan labs could design, manufactor, test, and refine products iteratively, and Carthage provided ample resources to this end in exchange for patents.

### 224: Carthage opens portal nexus
Trade accelerated with the sudden introduction of instant and covert channels of trade. Europan mercenaries became a world-wide commodity showcased in virtually every theater of war or policing action.

### 266: Divine invasion of Europa
Moros, on a whim, decided to call upon the goblins of mainland Europe to retake the land. When he discovered they had been annihilated in the region, he devised the orcs to create a divine war against the military build-up of Europa. Without centralized cities, Europa only had occasion to repel weekly waves of orc, goblin, and demon attacks.

### 273: Europa develops nuclear weapons
Seeking some means to end the seemingly unending waves of orc invaders, Europa focused research into a new project, a bomb capable of destroying a divine. The first underground test finished in 273, marking the beginning of Europan nuclear capabilities. A great portion of Europan GDP was diverted into production of more of these nuclear weapons as well as rocket delivery systems.

Moros took this moment to stop further waves of invasion. Instead, he focused his resources in building up an army large enough to take Europa in a single attack. Demon covert operations to derail the Europan nuclear program proved unsuccessful, and by the end of 273 Europa had developed a small arsennal of nuclear weapons.

### 274: The divine civil war starts after Albion and Europa suffer from nuclear detonations
Early in 274 Moros's orc army, supported by goblins in the North, attacked Europa. Europan lines of defense were pushed back, one by one, as shear numbers overcame Europa's superior firepower. When Moros himself showed up to the front-lines, Europan leadership fired their entire arsennal.

On the 52nd day of 274 a swarm of arcane missiles with nuclear warheads launched up and out of the atmosphere, curving back down to carpet occupied Europan cities, large battle zones, and Albion in nuclear hellfire. Moros was incinerated along with the greater portion of Europa. A cloud of debris blotted out the sun and killed the population without shelter or provisions for the nuclear winter that ensued.

On the 102nd day of 274 a new faction of divines formed with the goal of bringing all divines back to the divine realm and permanently sealing the gap between the two realms. A war broke out among these divines and others opposed to the plan. Consequently, Europa endured further damage as it became the battleground for these disputes. 

### 280: The divine exodus sends the majority of divines out of the overworld
Those who escaped the initial symptoms of nuclear war were again tested by divine war. Regions untouched by the bombs were flattened as divines and their followers converged to fight in this ruined land, where further destruction was considered unimportant. By the conclusion of these skirmishes, the divines left Europa filled with monsters and further ruin. Europan survivors were almost non-existant, and those left lacked any technical understanding of the technologies left over from the earlier age.

One of three Europan cities remained intact, and became the sole home for New Europa. It was left with only a few dozen inhabitants, the remainder of an exodus of refugees to other lands.
