# Europa

# Prologue
Combatants from the dream realm set up shop on the plains of Europe. Unlike their rivals in Persia that brought arcane knowledge, these dreamers brought glimpses of technology yet to be discovered. 

The nomadic hordes of the continent gathered around the dreamers and learned to harness steel, gunpowder, and coal. The dreamers left behind Europa, a fledgeling nation-state held together entirely by the will of the people to control their own fates using technology. 

The divines demanded access to these technologies, and were sharply denied. Armies of orcs, goblins, and demons were crafted from flesh in order to teach Europa a lesson in humility. To their utter shock, Europa fended off the initial attacks with ease.

The battles continued on a near-weekly basis, enabled only by the partnership with Carthage. Harnessing nuclear power, Europa offered a bountiful supply of mana in exchange for the raw materials needed to feed, cloth, and arm their people. Shortly after acquiring magic technology from Carthage, Europa built a number of enormous cubic fortresses atop their largest mines. Each hosted its own nuclear reactors, portals to Carthage's nexus, and force shields capable of deflecting artillery fire.

These fortresses, often referred to as boxes due to their shape, were soon filled past their capacity as farmers and other residents of the countryside were relocated. When overcrowded bunks reached their absolute limit, additional housing was built deep under the ground in the mines branching out beneath the structures. Underground crops, illuminated artificial light, supplemented the rations delivered by Carthage. These refuges immediately fell into industrial roles sending carts of ore to Carthage, manufacturing equipment and supplies for the Europan military effort, and training for combat. Every man, woman, and child was issued a firearm by the state and taught to use it, meaning that Europa could defend itself to the very last if a box's defenses were successfully broken.

Several atomic bombs were produced, deemed planet busters. When the divines grew tired of watching their armies getting reliably defeated, they took matters into their own hands. Europa elected to be destroyed before it could be captured, detonating bombs to kill each of the attacking divines. The resulting wasteland was overrun by magical creatures that fed on radiation. Blast sites and critical reactors flooded with hordes of these monsters, the beasts unwittingly serving as protectors of Europas many artifacts and lost technologies.

## Europan lostech
The scientists that created Europa's technological marvels were incinerated along with their research notes when the bombs went off, leaving behind devices of finite quantity for which the world lacks requisite knowledge to repair or replace. 

### Digital computers
Utilizing electricity flowing through a circuit board, digital computers provide fast and consistent mathematical calculations where soul computors demonstrate the same speed and accuracy as living minds. All Europan vehicles have circuit boards here or there in their design, and their electronic radios employ computers for the encryption and decryption of messages. Without finding schematics or reverse-engineering this technology, the best that can be hoped for is to keep a stock of extra boards to swap out broken units with.

### Nuclear power
Splitting the atom had destroyed Europa, but not before building it up. Early on in its existence, Europa had secured its first contract with Carthage by selling cheap electricity produced by a nuclear power plant. Conversion of radiation directly into mana, however, proved an even more potent source of wealth. Carthage paid happily for a consistent source of mana to power its industrial activity.

## Europan exports

Following the divine wars and destruction of Europa, Carthage trade ships have viewed the region as cheap land upon which to set up several businesses.

Labor:
    - global prison
    - deadly gameshows
Goods:
    - lost-tech artifacts
    - building materials
    - exotic arcane beasts

## Ambitions

The only Europans that survived the divine cataclysm did so due to their residence of Europan defense cubes. The appearance of beasts in the mines below the cubes combined with a dwindling food source forced all but Cube East from being evacuated. Consequently, Cube East's population seek to recover technology from the neighboring cubes, restore trade with Carthage, and rebuild. The arrival of beasts, the establishment of New Sparta, and the radioactivity plaguing this prevent its immediate completion.
