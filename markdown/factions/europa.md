# Europa

# Prologue
Combatants from the dream realm set up shop on the plains of Europe. Unlike their rivals in Persia that brought arcane knowledge, these dreamers brought glimpses of technology yet to be discovered. 

The nomadic hordes of the continent gathered around the dreamers and learned to harness steel, gunpowder, and coal. The dreamers left behind Europa, a fledgeling nation state held together entirely by technology. 

When the divines demanded Europa share their secrets with their demon, goblin, and orc armies, they were met with violent resistance. Bodies piled up when these unnatural armies charged fortified trenches wielding artillery and machine guns.

The battles continued, and Carthage replaced raw materials in exchange for the latest of Europan science. Left to fend for themselves with superior firepower as their only line of defense, Europa eventually came in posession of nuclear power. 

Several atomic bombs were produced, deemed planet busters. When the divines grew tired of watching their armies getting reliably defeated every week, they took matters into their own hands. Europa elected to be destroyed before it could be captured, detonating bombs to kill each of the attacking divines. The resulting wasteland was overrun by magical creatures that fed on radiation. Blast sites and critical reactors flooded with hordes of these monsters, the beasts unwittingly serving as protectors of Europas many artifacts and lost technologies.
