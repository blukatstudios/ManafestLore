# Europa

# Prologue
Combatants from the dream realm set up shop on the plains of Europe. Unlike their rivals in Persia that brought arcane knowledge, these dreamers brought glimpses of technology yet to be discovered. 

The nomadic hordes of the continent gathered around the dreamers and learned to harness steel, gunpowder, and coal. The dreamers left behind Europa, a fledgeling nation-state held together entirely by the will of the people to control their own fates using technology. 

The divines demanded access to these technologies, and were sharply denied. Armies of orcs, goblins, and demons were crafted from flesh in order to teach Europa a lesson in humility. To their utter shock, Europa fended off the initial attacks with ease.

The battles continued on a near-weekly basis, enabled only by the partnership with Carthage. Harnessing nuclear power, Europa offered a bountiful supply of mana in exchange for the raw materials needed to feed, cloth, and arm their people. Shortly after acquiring magic technology from Carthage, Europa built a number of enormous cubic fortresses atop their largest mines. Each hosted its own nuclear reactors, portals to Carthage's nexus, and force shields capable of deflecting artillery fire.

These fortresses, often referred to as boxes due to their shape, were soon filled past their capacity as farmers and other residents of the countryside were relocated. When overcrowded bunks reached their absolute limit, additional housing was built deep under the ground in the mines branching out beneath the structures. Underground crops, illuminated artificial light, supplemented the rations delivered by Carthage. These refuges immediately fell into industrial roles sending carts of ore to Carthage, manufacturing equipment and supplies for the Europan military effort, and training for combat. Every man, woman, and child was issued a firearm by the state and taught to use it, meaning that Europa could defend itself to the very last if a box's defenses were successfully broken.

Several atomic bombs were produced, deemed planet busters. When the divines grew tired of watching their armies getting reliably defeated, they took matters into their own hands. Europa elected to be destroyed before it could be captured, detonating bombs to kill each of the attacking divines. The resulting wasteland was overrun by magical creatures that fed on radiation. Blast sites and critical reactors flooded with hordes of these monsters, the beasts unwittingly serving as protectors of Europas many artifacts and lost technologies.

## Europan lostech
The scientists that created Europa's technological marvels were incinerated along with their research notes when the bombs went off, leaving behind devices of finite quantity for which the world lacks requisite knowledge to repair or replace. 

### Digital computers
Utilizing electricity flowing through a circuit board, digital computers provide fast and consistent mathematical calculations where soul computors demonstrate the same speed and accuracy as living minds. All Europan vehicles have circuit boards here or there in their design, and their electronic radios employ computers for the encryption and decryption of messages. Without finding schematics or reverse-engineering this technology, the best that can be hoped for is to keep a stock of extra boards to swap out broken units with.

### Nuclear power
Splitting the atom had destroyed Europa, but not before building it up. Early on in its existence, Europa had secured its first contract with Carthage by selling cheap electricity produced by a nuclear power plant. Conversion of radiation directly into mana, however, proved an even more potent source of wealth. Carthage paid happily for a consistent source of mana to power its industrial activity.

## Europan exports

Following the divine wars and destruction of Europa, Carthage trade ships have viewed the region as cheap land upon which to set up several businesses.

Labor:
    - global prison
    - deadly gameshows
Goods:
    - lost-tech artifacts
    - building materials
    - exotic arcane beasts

## Ambitions

### Restoration
The only Europans that survived the divine cataclysm did so due to their residence of Europan defense cubes. The appearance of beasts in the mines below the cubes combined with a dwindling food source forced all but Cube East from being evacuated. Consequently, Cube East's population seek to recover technology from the neighboring cubes, restore trade with Carthage, and rebuild. The arrival of beasts, the establishment of New Sparta, and the radioactivity plaguing the region prevent its immediate completion of these goals.

### Moonward Expansion
Though unrealized, the true potential of the cubes to be used as space vessels proved interesting to Carthage and the remnants of Europa alike. Rather than leave the box they had called home, many of the Europans sought instead to raid the other cubes for scientific papers and documentation necessary to finish spacefaring preparations and bring the cube into space.


## Pre-Europa timeline

### 0AD: Arival of divines
When the divines arrived, Moros terrorized mainland Europa with the creation of goblins. Originally, he used them as foot soldiers to subdue and collect tribute from the scattered tribes in the region. This created a flow of refugees moving to Rome, persia, and Albion to escape the goblin armies.

### 93: Demon army invades Albion
After years of turmoil, Albion sent forces to clear mainland Europe from threat of goblin warlords. With his armies broken, Moros saw to the creation of the demon army to bring Albion to heal. Albion forces on the European mainland were pushed back into Albion's main isles, where they suffered several crushing blows.

The currents of refugees reversed. Rather than face complete defeat in battle, the kingdom of Albion sent its remaining population to the mainland under guard by the remnants of the Albion military.

## Europa timeline

### 110: Europa established
With the demon army preoccupied with ruling Albion, the survivors in mainland Europe sought to rebuild quickly and securely. Trade with Carthage gave them access to an economy of scale they simply lacked, and Carthage security firms soon took interest in opportunities on the frontlines. 

In 110 the three major military bases of Europa founded a constitution and a new military campaign to retake the mainland and eventually Albion as well.

### 123: Europa retakes continent
Pushing Moros's abandoned armies North, Europa freed its plains and forests for reconstruction. Implicit in Europan architecture is provision for defense in the event of goblin or demon resurgence. The three initial Europan forts became showcases for the latest and greatest military breakthroughs Carthage had to offer. Research and development contracts opened in the region to reduce Carthage's millitary industrial footprint in its native lands. Europan labs could design, manufactor, test, and refine products iteratively, and Carthage provided ample resources to this end in exchange for patents.

### 224: Carthage opens portal nexus
Trade accelerated with the sudden introduction of instant and covert channels of trade. Europan mercenaries became a world-wide commodity showcased in virtually every theater of war or policing action.

### 266: Divine invasion of Europa
Moros, on a whim, decided to call upon the goblins of mainland Europe to retake the land. When he discovered they had been annihilated in the region, he devised the orcs to create a divine war against the military build-up of Europa. Without centralized cities, Europa only had occasion to repel weekly waves of orc, goblin, and demon attacks.

### 273: Europa develops nuclear weapons
Seeking some means to end the seemingly unending waves of orc invaders, Europa focused research into a new project, a bomb capable of destroying a divine. The first underground test finished in 273, marking the beginning of Europan nuclear capabilities. A great portion of Europan GDP was diverted into production of more of these nuclear weapons as well as rocket delivery systems.

Moros took this moment to stop further waves of invasion. Instead, he focused his resources in building up an army large enough to take Europa in a single attack. Demon covert operations to derail the Europan nuclear program proved unsuccessful, and by the end of 273 Europa had developed a small arsennal of nuclear weapons.

### 274: The divine civil war starts after Albion and Europa suffer from nuclear detonations
Early in 274 Moros's orc army, supported by goblins in the North, attacked Europa. Europan lines of defense were pushed back, one by one, as shear numbers overcame Europa's superior firepower. When Moros himself showed up to the front-lines, Europan leadership fired their entire arsennal.

On the 52nd day of 274 a swarm of arcane missiles with nuclear warheads launched up and out of the atmosphere, curving back down to carpet occupied Europan cities, large battle zones, and Albion in nuclear hellfire. Moros was incinerated along with the greater portion of Europa. A cloud of debris blotted out the sun and killed the population without shelter or provisions for the nuclear winter that ensued.

On the 102nd day of 274 a new faction of divines formed with the goal of bringing all divines back to the divine realm and permanently sealing the gap between the two realms. A war broke out among these divines and others opposed to the plan. Consequently, Europa endured further damage as it became the battleground for these disputes. 

### 280: The divine exodus sends the majority of divines out of the overworld
Those who escaped the initial symptoms of nuclear war were again tested by divine war. Regions untouched by the bombs were flattened as divines and their followers converged to fight in this ruined land, where further destruction was considered unimportant. By the conclusion of these skirmishes, the divines left Europa filled with monsters and further ruin. Europan survivors were almost non-existant, and those left lacked any technical understanding of the technologies left over from the earlier age.

One of three Europan cities remained intact, and became the sole home for New Europa. It was left with only a few dozen inhabitants, the remainder of an exodus of refugees to other lands.
