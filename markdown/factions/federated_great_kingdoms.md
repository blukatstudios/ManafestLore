# Federated Great Kingdoms

# Prologue

The kingdoms that littered the Indian subcontinent were very easily overpowered by divine invaders. Once the area was secured, the conquerers divied up the kingdoms and let the people therein continue their lives business as usual, aside from prayers and creation of the monsters.

The divines that held the kingdoms practiced flesh craft regularly and made many monsters. Each kingdom chose one of these creations as its protector and made it more powerful with a stream of daily prayers. These creatures fought as a first line of defense against neighbors as well as provide help to its people.

The relative insignificance of non-mage humanoids fighting with unsophisticated weapons against these monsters led to the convention of allowing monster battles to determine the outcome of political strife. If a nation's monster lost, it's people would take severe casualties from trying to fight the victor. Thus warfare reduced heavily in the region, and in that time the population and economy boomed.

When the divine civil war took place, the less-than-divine creations of fleshcraft were entirely ignored, leaving the federation unchanged.
