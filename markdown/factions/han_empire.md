# Han Empire

The Han Empire brought the compass, gunpowder, paper making, and printing to the world. When the powerful divine, the **god of industry** came to the region, he praised the ingenuity of these clever people. Tens of thousands of their swelling population were transformed into **gnomes**, tiny humanoids smaller than children.

Cities built workshops for the gnomes to live in where food and raw materials were converted into finished goods. Nimble gnome fingers worked faster and with greater precision than their human counterparts, and on less than a third of the food and living space. 

Tooling for these workshops resulted in an abundant supply of manufactured goods. These workshops doubled as laboratories where gnomes engineered new prototypes. Rifles with paper cartridges found their way into Han armies that took the Korean peninsula and fended off mongols. Ironclad steamships annexed the many islands of Japan, securing the region under imperial control. 


## Municipal Gnome Boxes
Once gnomes showed their true value in transforming raw materials into beatifully crafted goods, the first gnome box was constructed in a city center. The structure stood four stories high. The interior provided a three-story chamber used by gnomes to work on larger projects or to comfortably fit a human inside to conduct business. The building surrounding the chamber was honeycombed with multi-purpose sweets the gnomes could use as living quarters, workshops, storage, or even offices.

Outside the first, and later gnome boxes was a sign detailing services and prices. Human Hans dropped off order forms, payment, and any raw resources needed to complete the orders. They would then return to find a note pinned to the board stating the status of the project's progress. Eventually, the finished project would be left inside the gnome house. The ease, speed, and cost of this arrangement was so successful that gnome boxes popped up in the center of all major cities. Some of these boxes exploded in size, reaching fifty gnome stories and offering multiple large chambers for projects of industrial magnitude.

Not long after their construction, the Han empire hired the residents of these boxes to begin performing administrative duties. In addition to mending, crafting, or processing goods, citizens could use the gnome boxes to play taxes, deliver mail, and perform other paperwork.
