# Han Empire

# Prologue

The Han Empire brought the compass, gunpowder, paper making, and printing to the world. When the powerful divine, the **god of industry** came to the region, he praised the ingenuity of these clever people. Tens of thousands of their swelling population were transformed into **gnomes**, tiny humanoids smaller than children.

Cities built workshops for the gnomes to live in where food and raw materials were converted into finished goods. Nimble gnome fingers worked faster and with greater precision than their human counterparts, and on less than a third of the food and living space. 

Tooling for these workshops resulted in an abundant supply of manufactured goods. These workshops doubled as laboratories where gnomes engineered new prototypes. Rifles with paper cartridges found their way into Han armies that took the Korean peninsula and fended off mongols. Ironclad steamships annexed the many islands of Japan.

## Han labs
A few of the workshops are dedicated toward the study and reverse-engineering of foreign technological artifacts. With help from Carthage, these result in the following experimental advances:
- oil automobiles
- oil airplanes
- Oil mobile armor

## Han exports
Naturally, Carthage set down airships on Han land to ferry goods and labor. Without the global food market and exchange of Han goods, even the gnomes would have starved.
