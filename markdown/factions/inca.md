# Inca

# Prologue

Inca grew with the presence of stone elementals that helped them terrace cliff faces into farmable land and refine metal into tools. The divines did not interfere with the Incans, and so they continued their quiet existence even after the the divine civil war, slowly growing with isolationist policies and mineral-minded technological advances.

# Sandbox

The Incans are forced into global trade when Carthagean airships show up to either trade or invade. Part of the initial agreement signed led Carthage to refer to the Incan empire's location as being a distant, newly discovered chain of islands. This rendered Carthage the exclusive trade partner with the Incans, rendering their abundance of exotic produce and mineral wealth available to the world with a Carthage markup. 

## Cuzco Labs
Carthage established laboratories dedicated to the study of the stone elementals and their powers. Advancements stemming from this research include: 
- magic mobile armor, augmented strength from a frame that mounts armor and equipment
- phylactory suits, functioning bodies for trapped souls
- transmutation stations where large amounts of mana can be applied to convert elements
