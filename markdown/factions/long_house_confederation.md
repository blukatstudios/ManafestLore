# Long House Confederation

# Prologue

The people of the confederation lived peacefully alongside the fae and dragons that came from the Ice Realm. Paying tribute, they earned protection from the dragons and small miracles from the fae.

When the divines came, the dragons defended the region from aggressors and only the weakest of the divines was allowed to see the peoples there. She was the **nature goddess** that became the clan mother of the people and offered her own miracles with help from the fae. Willing followers were transformed into beast men that met the wild land with primal instincts, claws, and jaws. The increased fecundity of these beast men led to a population boom that spread their kind across the continent.

As soon as the Aztec slavers began praying upon nomads in the South, the Long House Confederation expanded broad membership with hundreds of small tribes. The clan mother, the goddess off nature, grew powerful with prayers from her new nation.
