# Long House Confederation

# Prologue

The people of the confederation lived peacefully alongside the fae and dragons that came from the Ice Realm. Paying tribute, they earned protection from the dragons and small miracles from the fae.

When the divines came, the dragons defended the region from aggressors and only the weakest of the divines was allowed to see the peoples there. She was the **nature goddess** that became the clan mother of the people and offered her own miracles with help from the fae. Willing followers were transformed into beast men that met the wild land with primal instincts, claws, and jaws. The increased fecundity of these beast men led to a population boom that spread their kind across the continent.

As soon as the Aztec slavers began praying upon nomads in the South, the Long House Confederation expanded broad membership with hundreds of small tribes. The clan mother, the goddess of nature, grew powerful with prayers from her new nation.

## Ambitions

### Gaia Economy
The creation of the beast man provided a superior breed of hunter-gatherer that could stand the harshness of the elements, traverse the wilderness, and live a lean existence of few creature comforts. The fae admired these new inhabitants, and the two formed a symbiotic relationship. The fae enriched the wild edibles to feed the beast men and their game. In exchange, the beast men prevented tilling of the Earth and felling of the forests. One by one, the human tribes were pushed back to hunting and gathering, drawn to the peninsula where they would be made into heartier beast men.

The fae offered circles of stone within which they permitted permanent structures. The forests surrounding these circles were made particularly fruitful by a comination of forest gardening and fae magic. The small sedentary population that could live off the fruit of their surroundings stay in the lands to converse with the fae and learn from them. One of the greatest gifts of the fae was the discovery of the arcane properties of the herbs brought from the ice realm. A wide variety of potions to cure various ailments and provide as many benefits are a hallmark of trade with the Confederation.

The only exception to the fae's circles are the central forests of the great peninsula, where the beast men were first born. Knowledge of this fact drives displaced humans to the land, where they can be transformed and sent back to serve the fae. It is the fae's plan to spread elsewhere and uproot the establishments that impede the flourishing of natural life.

### The Small Dog
The fae safe zone on the peninsula has grown crowded with with human Condeferates farming the land and making trade with foreign entities. Even with the blessing of the fae, dragons, and nature goddess, the confederacy is at a severe disadvantage economically, militarily, and technologically. Raiding parties routinely capture tribes of beast men as slaves on the South border with Azteca, forcing the Confederacy to deploy rangers to the area to free existing slaves and prevent future captures.

A second campaign is headed by a small group of chiefs sent out to the corners of the world. In addition to attracting immigrants to the confederacy, the chiefs aim to secure technology and artifacts of strategic value. Most generally these actions are performed legally, but at certain times heists and prison breaks are employed to win artifacts and personnel for the confederacy's war efforts in destabilized regions where weapons can be cheaply acquired on the black market.
