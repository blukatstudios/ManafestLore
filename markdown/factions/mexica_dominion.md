# Mexica Dominion

## Timeline

### 500 BD birth of fleshcraft

A group of Nahua led by monks ventured into the Valley of Mexico and established the city of Aztecah. The monks used their arcane knowledge of mild healing magics to trade in the region. As they took on apprentices and sharpened their skills, the city grew into a hub for the sick and direly wounded. One could trade their indentured servitude in echange for a life-saving feat of restorative magic. In these early days, Aztecah grew by taking in the unwanted populace from elsewhere.

### 300 BD Flesh elementals

Not satisfied with mere restoration of health, the growing school of fleshcraft expanded its horizons to explore altering one's physical form. Augmenting musculature, bone, skin, and organs started as a treatment for the crippled and weak. As successes began to outnumber failures, so began experiments to make better laborers. The limits of the human form were explored, understood, and then pushed. Aztecah's king put this new technology to use developing extremely modified humanoid weapons. The flesh elementals were born as collections of bodies combined together with the goal of survival. A man with five hearts, three heads, several lungs, and limbs as thick as tree trunks could not only survive several otherwise fatal injuries through redundancy, but could live indefinitely by replacing individual organs as they failed. Criminals, prisoners of war, and even fresh corpses were used to maintain, restore, and grow these beasts. Later advances led to the realiziation that non-human organs such as venomous fangs from snakes or large sections of bone could be grafted onto flesh elementals, giving them further inhuman features.

As weapons, flesh elementals proved particularly useful in deterring combatants by the prospect of capture and incorporation into the beasts. Stone swords, spears, and bows proved largely ineffective against the redundant vital organs and grafted layers of bone armor. Aztecah conquered its neighbors and collected tribute with the aid of flesh elementals to simply prevent combat in many cases.

Repurposing elementals as beasts of burden proved incredibly lucrative. The creatures pulled multiple plows, carried stacks of timber on their backs, and carved stone at an alarming rate. Incorporating large amounts of spider spinnerettes allowed the production of spider silk as a textile good. Organs from alpacas allowed flesh elementals to thrive on vegetation in addition to the startling ability to gestate alpaca offspring in large batches. Most of these elementals, such as those with birds incorporated in order to produce eggs, were rendered immobile. Farmers fed the creatures grasses and vegetation, harvesting their goods.

Expansion pushed boarders outward at a pace limited by logistics alone. Income from trade began to outpace tribute, and so the Mexica Dominion was established to replace a network of tribute with a system of taxation and governmental control.
