# New Sparta

# Prologue

Originally formed by hordes of displaced Roman citizens, the first neo-spartans moved North to Europa's ruins to settle there. New Sparta made itself known when it began intercepting scavengers and traders in Europa's ruins, seizing lost technology to drive up its existing premium value. The acquisition of a nuclear warhead dissuaded Rome and other neighboring powers from direct intervention, and so the wastes of Europa became largely Spartan territory.

## Spartan Exports

Lost technologies make up the bulk of Spartan trade goods, although the nation trades them for roughly a hundred times the price scavengers originally asked. 

## Ambitions

**Excavations**
Sparta has made a business of clearing out beast-infested ruins and pulling the lost tech from them. Most of the safe locations have been thoroughly looted, leaving mostly the Europa defense cubes and their underground networks behind.
