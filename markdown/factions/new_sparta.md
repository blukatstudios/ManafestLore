# New Sparta

## History

## 280 AD New Sparta is born
Hordes of urban Romans fled the streets in search of employment elsewhere. One popular location was the site of the Europan ruins, an area dense with valuable magical creatures and artifacts ripe for the harvest. A band of deserting soldiers fled Northward into the territory as well, aiming to exercise their military strength to make a new life. New Sparta was born when this band of ex-Roman soldiers enslaved a small army of slaves to till the land and raise walls for the new capital. Neo-Spartan warriors left on expeditions, returning with exotic game and lost technologies to sell to the Roman government, which accepted this trade begrudgingly. Once they had acquired a nuclear warhead, New Sparta gained impunity in their further growing foothold in the region.
