# Persian Empire

# Prologue

Persia was born alongside the dreamers, refugees of a civil war in the Dream Realm. The dreamers taught the Persians all they knew of the arcane arts, and soon Persia became a home of mages. Neighboring regions fell to armies that wielded firballs that singed flesh and force shields that deflected arrows and spears. 

The dreamers vanished as mysteriously as they had appeared, leaving Persia a powerful and magically-endowed political entity. In stable regions mages made fire without wood, pulled fresh water from sea air, and made ice from water.

## Mage services
By wielding the arcane arts, normal workers became capable of feats only awarded by expensive technology previously.

- **Fire**: The sparse supply of firewood was overcome immediately by arcane flames that burned by mana alone. These were used to boil water, cook food, and even forge metals with only the price of labor.
- **Light**: Though few were hired as lamps, the ability to produce flameless light on command increased the effectiveness of jobs performed at night or underground.
- **Levitation**: When not capable of entirely lifting an object, levitation magic could reduce the strain put on carts or beasts of burden. Enormous stone slabs could be reduced to the weight of mere stones, allowing construction with great ease.
- **Cooling**: In addition to offering creature comforts inside buildings, cooling magic was employed near bodies of salt water to produce fresh water from the air. From any form of water, ice could be produced and sold for food preservation among other uses.
- **Communications**: Many mages turned a profit off of their services delivering and receiving messages from a great distance.
