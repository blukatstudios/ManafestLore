# Persian Empire

# Prologue

Persia was born alongside the dreamers, refugees of a civil war in the Dream Realm. The dreamers taught the Persians all they knew of the arcane arts, and soon Persia became a home of mages. Neighboring regions fell to armies that wielded firballs that singed flesh and force shields that deflected arrows and spears. 

The dreamers vanished as mysteriously as they had appeared, leaving Persia a powerful and magically-endowed political entity. In stable regions mages made fire without wood, pulled fresh water from sea air, and made ice from water.
