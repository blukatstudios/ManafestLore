# Roman Empire

# Prologue

The divines intervened in the collapse of the Roman Empire, preventing it. Instead of merely delaying the collapse, the weaker divines gathered in flocks to share the minor miracles they were capable of. Many took on personas borrowed from the Roman pantheons(and when it was used up, the Greek), offering help to those that prayed for it. Consequently, the populace was cured of lead poisoning, their farmlands were made fertile, and provincial governments performed their own tax collection. Holy relics were created from the souls of those executed for crimes. Relics were distributed secretly among the loyalty, striking fear of unknown powers into would-be rebels.

The divine civil war took the vast majority of divines away from Rome, leaving it in mortal hands once again. The relic-holders headed by a king took over Rome and immediately began exiling the excess urban populations that could no longer be sustained by routine agricultural miracles.

Following the divine civil war Rome assessed the population as largely dispensible in the service of badly-needed stability. Those without relics found themselves exiled to largely untamed lands surrounding the empire, emptying the streets of possible rioters. This relief of burden comforted the soft center of the Roman empire, allowing the rigid walls protecting it to focus their firepower outward.


## Remaining pantheon
Though the vast majority of divines were taken in the civil war, some stragglers and low-profile divines were left behind. These divines now act primarily as celebrities, offering their support for Rome in its time of decline. 

### Diana, goddess of the moon, the hunt, and young maidens
Diana returned to Rome after a three month hunt to find the civil war had started and ended without her. She became an agent the Roman intelligence, infiltrating the population and tracking down rebels.

### Hephaestus, god of blacksmiths
In humanoid form, Hephaestus was overlooked in the civil war. Since then he was employed to reverse-engineer magical and technological artifacts in order to continue expansion of Rome's arsennal.

### Mnemosyne, goddess of memory, and her 9 muses
She and her muses were in humanoid forms at the time of the divine civil war, and so simply remained this way while it took place, observing every detail in order to make art of it.

The Romans recruited her ensemble of muses as a source of propaganda and distraction from the harsh realities of the new regime.
