# Federated Great Kingdoms

The kingdoms that litered the Indian subcontinent were very easily overpowered by divine invaders. Once the area was secured, the conquerers divied up the kingdoms and let the people therein continue their lives business as usual, aside from prayers and creation of the monsters.

The divines that held the kingdoms practiced flesh craft regularly and made many monsters. Each kingdom chose one of these creations and made it more powerful with a stream of daily prayers. These creatures would fight as a first line of defense against neighbors as well as provide help to its people.
