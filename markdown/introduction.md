# Introduction

## What is Manafest?
Manafest is a high fantasy science fiction universe intended for use
with a video game. This lore sets up substance such as factions, 
technologies, characters, and rules of the universe that can be used
in flexible timelines decided by gameplay.

## Segments of Manafest

### Prologue
The events leading up to the interactive portion of the universe can
be considered a prologue. It is linear and its events can be defined
in great detail. A simple overview.

- In the distant future, a technological singularity is created.
- That technological singularity converts the universe and neighboring dimensions into one massive computer.
- The computer hosts a simulation of the solar system in a virtual world.
- Many copies of this simulation are run, each with a different version of Mana present.
- The life in these alternate worlds eventually use mana to connect to the first.
- The history of Earth is changed dramatically by these connections around the year 1 BC.

### Sandbox
Following the linear segment comes information on the factions arising on Earth as a result of
interference by other realms(the aforementioned alternate worlds) and the mana they introduce.

It's important to note that historical accuracy is not the highest priority of this project, nor
is it one that is deemed possible with the time and resources available. Best guesses and secondary
sources are acceptable under the premise that each historical civilization is completely transformed
by exposure to this shared timeline.
