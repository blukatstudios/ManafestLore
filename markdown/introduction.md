# Introduction

## What is Manafest?
Manafest is a high fantasy science fiction universe intended for use with a video game. This lore sets up substance such as factions, technologies, characters, and rules of the universe that can be used in flexible timelines decided by gameplay.

## Broad timeline

### Genesis
- In the distant future, a technological singularity is created.
- That technological singularity converts the universe and neighboring dimensions into one massive computer.
- The computer hosts a simulation of the solar system in a virtual world.
- Many copies of this simulation are run, each with a different version of Mana present.
- The life in these alternate worlds eventually use mana to connect to the first.
- The history of each Earth is changed dramatically by these connections around the year 1 BC.

## Realms
These are the paralel dimensions that connect with the overworld.

**Overworld**
The mana of the overworld is mundane in that it retains energy, but cannot in itself perform magic.

**Underworld**
In the underworld physical mass and energy are converted into mana. Those mortals that venture into the underworld never return.

**Divine Realm**
In the divine realm the mana is exceptionally energy-dense, allowing extremely powerful magic. Exceedingly powerful mages in the realm have transcended their biology and can perform god-like miracles effortlessly.

**Ice Realm**
In this realm mana became sequestered into matter, creating a wide range of arcane materials with magical properties. As life emerged, it incorporated these materials into itself and created a world of magical creatures. For reasons only speculated on, the planet was overcome with an ice age and the most powerful beasts(the dragons and the fae) opened portals to emigrate to the overworld rather than freeze and starve.

**Fire Realm**
In this realm latent mana energy converted to energy, expanding Sol until it engufled the entire system. Eventually souls formed and this ball of plasma became a primordial soup for beings composed entirely of energy. These fire elementals hopped dimensions to live in the overworld in its core and the start it orbited. 

**Stone Realm**
Life emerged in asteroid fields in this realm long before it had on Earth. Meteorites brought the first stone elementals planetside at around the time of the cretaceous, and not long after that they gained enough energy to open portals to the overworld.

**Blood Realm**
Mana formed organic compounds with its latent reactions in this realm. The first organisms to harness this property formed a dense layer of what looked like fungus accross the planet's surface. Eventually sentience arose as this mass became a colonial organism. The first few portals to the overworld established sites of this unique fungal bloom that spread the first cases of ghoul fever.
