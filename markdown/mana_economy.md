# Mana Economy
With the introduction of various magical technologies, economy is fundamentally altered.
Below applies magic to varying existing levels of non-magic technology.

## Artisan Mages
Any society that lacks the arcane materials or sciences thereof requisite of magical machinery must instead rely on individuals to perform their magical feats. This creates a few archetypal professions that a magic user may assume. 

### Seekers
One of the most useful powers for a hunter gatherer tribe is long-distance acquisition of targers. A seeker that knows the position of prey can lead a hunting party to circle it from outside range of detection, then close in for the kill.

### Heaters
Heater mages are no more than giant magnifying glasses that accept any energy source as light.
Direct sunlight, a moving river, or strong winds are generally sources tapped into. Very skilled heaters can focus their heat sharply enough to start fires or cook meals, while the more novice can serve to heat a house or tent smokelessly. Few take a day job as a heater, though it can mean life or death for residents of colder regions.

### Coolers
Whereas heaters convert mana to heat, coolers convert heat to mana. The conversion usually breaks even due to the inefficiencies involved in pulling heat from cold air, but refrigeration can mean the difference between spoiled and fresh foods. As such, coolers can often be employed full time manning ice houses where perishibles are stored frozen. Depending on various factors, some foods will remain frozen a year or so and remain edible. This allows ice houses to serve as long-term
food storage for villages, cities, and nations.

### Healer
Healers acquire a toolbelt filled with various techniques to manipulate physiology, and it is the artful application of these techniques that decides the health of their patients.

Many sophomoric healers can learn to regenerate tissue rapidly, for instance, but it takes an experienced and disciplined mage to do so without carelessly regenerating infected tissue, or more subtly introducing tumors into their patient. The art of flesh craft, once mastered, leads a healer to pull an arrow out of a patient and seal their punctured meat in a hurry. A master can likewise trigger the growth of a new set of teeth, repair many cases of blindness or poor eyesight, or add muscle mass.

The magic of curing pathogenic disease is far more complex, such that only channeling the magic from divine sources can generally work. Even still, many mages work full time drawing the blessings of lesser divines to heal plague, tumors, and even some effects of aging.

### Levitators
Many mechnanical solutions to move large stones have been developed, but they fall short of the simplicity and relatively miniscule labor of three or four mages simply lifting the stone until it is light enough for a single worker to carry. A horse-drawn cart carrying what would normally be a few tons of rock is made possible by such services, and results in enormous stoneworks made for a fraction of the price of manual labor.

### Turners
Without wind for a windmill or water for a water wheel, one can turn to turners. You give them a wheel, and they'll give you torque. This can be applied to a stationary machine such as a clothing washer or mill, or can be applied to a horseless carriage or elevator. Some skilled turners can even spin the propellers of crude flying machines fast enough to keep them in the air. Turners are especially valuable aboard ships, as they can provide propulsion on windless days.

## Crude tools
From the ice realm came spell crystals, soul metal, and soul stone necessary to make primitive tools by carving, grinding, forging, and casting.

### Omnimage
A spell crystal tuned to cast a particular spell can be used by anyone, provided that person knows how to channel their mana. A fine spell crystal can cast the same simple spell that a master can, bridging the gap in human capital with physical capital. Consequently, all-purpose mages are hired for the sole purpose of contributing their stream of directed mana flow. A group of unskilled mages can heat a forge without fuel, freeze a river solid, or reverse that same river, provided the right crystal.

### Collectors
Soul stone can be crafted into a chamber that a bug or small animal can be trapped in. Once dead, that creature's soul can be accessed by a pin made from soul metal. This is a mana cell, and is the tool to store mana for controlled later use. Any novice mage can fill these vessels, and thus act as collectors. A novice mage with a spell crystal and a huge stockpile of mana can wield fearsome magic otherwise requiring a small mob of mages. A collector can pull from nearby energy sources, and so often circle large fires when they work.

### Crude autocasters
A mana cell connected to a spell crystal will channel its mana until emptied, thus creating a crude autocaster. Such a tool requires the operator to just press a button, flip a switch, or pull a trigger to wield magic. This is where the arcane sciences diverge from the arcane arts.

## Mechanized tools
Standardized parts allow for far more complex devices to be mass-produced, resulting in sophisticated automated processes. Consequently, the industry follows.

### Mana bank
Standardized mana cells held in a matrix result in modular, interchangeable units of measure for mana. One can enter a mana bank in order to buy a full cell in exchange for an empty one and some currency, or vise-versa. Massive mana cells containing souls from executed criminals allow smaller cells to be filled in mass, and for mana to be collected on an industrial scale from lines to nearby sources.

### Thermal collector
A large furnace with a fuel burning inside that converts a fearful quantity of mana. As long as a thermal collector is fed, it produces a continual supply of mana that can keep an attached energy grid supplied with mana for lighting, heating/cooling, and accessories.

### Mana motor
With a steady mana supply, horseless carriages can be propelled by mana motors alone. Such devices are not limited by biology and can move exceedingly fast, and as long as they are provided mana as fuel. Swapping a partial cell for a charged one at mana stations and mana banks allows such vehicles to move long distances with only momentary pauses. The same principle applies to flying machines.

### Arcane power tools
By pressurizing air, focusing intense heat, or direct force application, arcane power tools can drive nails, turn screws, saw without blades, weld metal, and even sew mechanically.  A shop with tools and mana can put out streamlined products more quickly and consistently  than its far larger mundane counterpart. Consequently, economy of scale for such tooling is superior to hand tools.

### Mana computor
A soul trapped in a mana cell can eventually learn to communicate through an attached cone made from soul metal. Such a being is mind without matter. Invulnerable to fatigue, the day/night cycle, or hunger, mana computers can provide information as well as a long-term retirement plan. Devoid of circuits, such a device can only talk.

## Digital tools
Learning that mana flows through soul metal, logical circuits were designed in order to create devices of incredible complexity.

### Automata
Souls trapped in bodies that they can control, Without the soul, the body is referred to as a phylactory suit. The bodies range in size, shape, and function dramatically depending on the purpose for which it was built. Many wealthy postpone death by becoming automata as they  grow old.

### Communicators, Holocenters
Offering audio and holographic projections as both a viewing media and user interface, those with mana and connections to others can broadcast and receive transmissions. These are mainly commercial and personal in nature, but also include such purposes as military communication.

### Databases
Often coupled with mana banks, databases consist of one or more computors to manage the database along with many computers that read and write data to and from physical media to form tables. The mark of a good database manager is the ability to perform queries by structuring the data systematically. In addition to archives and records, databases provide public service to computer networks.

### Computer internet
The internet is a series of connected communication towers that link databases with communicators and holocenters to provide near-instantaneous communication between any two linked machines. In addition to commercial applications, the internet provides government with a less visible form of surveilance over their citizens.

### Mobile suits
A phylactory suit, but intended for a living pilot with a physical body. These are generally constructed with industrial and military applications, however the physically injured user the smaller of suits to move around. A paralyzed man can wear the controlling headband and still have full control of such a machine. Smaller races such as gnomes make great use of mobile suits to interact with larger races in social settings.

### Iron giants
The logical conclusion of a mobile suit. Iron giants often pair a nuclear generator with an impressive battery of mana-consuming devices. In order to reach their larger sizes, a giant layered with integrity fields that offer much-needed strength to their structure. These same fields can be amplified in order to provide armor. Most smaller munitions will ricochet off of the hull of an iron giant. Usually the pilot is a computor to save space and reduce biological limitations in the design. An iron giant destroyed in enemy territory unleashes harmful radiation at the site of its wreck. Outside of military applications, iron giants are used to socialize with races such as dragons that might simply eat a smaller humanoid. Iron giants likewise make excellent vehicles both deep under water, in space, or in mountainout terrain where wheeled and tracked vehicles cannot climb steep slopes.
