# Pantheon
Here is a listing of noteworthy divines.

## Gaia
A goddess of nature, Gaia settled into North America to form the beast men and preserve the region from the ingress of mass agriculture and industry. She befriended the dragons to assist her in preservation of the continent.

## Ouranos
A god of sky, Ouranos settled into the early Han Empire where he formed the gnomes and organized the region.

## Moros
Moros arrived in central Europe and immediately went to work creating the goblins in the region. He moved on to create the demons as leaders for the goblins, and ordered them to take over Albion. After Europa expelled goblins from their borders, he declared war upon the state and created orcs in order to deliver unceasing waves of invasion against the Europan borders. Eventually Moros discovered Europa's development of nuclear weapons and personally lead an attack deep into Europan territory. He shortly died inside one of many mushroom clouds that rose in the destruction of Europa. 

## Dis Pater
Dis Pater originated from the underworld, not the divine realm. He subsists upon the souls of mortals in the overworld. Because he does not seek violent confrontation, he only targets those souls that are forgotten by mortals, or that are endebted to him. Even despite his predatory existence, he sells miracles to the mortals. These usually come in the form of alterations to one's soul, and are paid for with loans. Since their creation, Dis Pater has used Beta Demons to initiate contracts for minor miracles and trinkets.

## Blood God
The blood god is the life form that comprises most of the known blood realm, and is not from the divine realm. It has powerful psychic and flesh-crafting powers that it can use to create and control armies of minions with. After Moros's death and a nuclear attack on Albion, the blood good accepted the Alpha Demons as infiltrators to later use in its invasion of the overworld.
