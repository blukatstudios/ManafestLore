# Roman Empire

# Prologue

The divines intervened in the collapse of the Roman Empire, preventing it. Instead of merely delaying the collapse, the weaker divines gathered in flocks to share the minor miracles they were capable of. Many took on personas borrowed from the Greek and Roman pantheons, offering help to those that prayed for it. Consequently, the populace was cured of lead poisoning, their farmlands were made fertile, and provincial governments performed their own tax collection. Holy relics were created from the souls of those executed for crimes. Relics were distributed secretly among the loyalty, striking fear of unknown powers into would-be rebels.

The divine civil war took the vast majority of divines away from Rome, leaving it in mortal hands once again. The relic-holders headed by a king took over Rome and immediately began exiling the excess urban populations that could no longer be sustained by routine agricultural miracles.
