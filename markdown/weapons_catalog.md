## Long Bow
A flexible length of wood affixed on two ends with a strong string to create a tension and release to launch an arrow attached to the string.

![Recurve Bow](http://www.classic-bow.com/catalog/images/0820_recurve_bow.jpg)
## Recurve Bow
A more advanced version of the longbow with outward-curving limbs that deliver more energy, and so are ultimately used to shring the bow without losing firepower.

![Crossbow](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f2/DaVinci_Crossbow.JPG)
## Cross Bow
By increasing the poundage, using a metal bolt instead of an arrow, and locking bow into the fired position before use, the cross bow offers superior firepower and an incredibly slow rate of fire. A crank is generally used to cock crossbows.

**Mods** 
- Second Bow - Crank once, fire twice. Nearly double base weight.
- Third Bow - Crank once, fire thrice. Nearly triple base weight.
- Magic auto crank - use mana to crank the crossbow quickly. Increase weight.
- Internal Magazine - loads a stored bolt automatically when cocked. (Can't use with second or third bow)
- Top rail
- Under Rail

![Air Gun](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/48/Girandoni_Air_Rifle.jpg)
## Air Gun
Pressurized gas from a reserve tank propels a bullet (or musket ball) through the weapon's barrel at high speed. Nearly silent when compared with firearms.

**Mods**
- Rifling - Increases accuracy and range.
- Large tank - Hold more air for additional shots. Added weight.
- Mana pump - use mana to restore air pressure
- Hand pump - pump to restore air pressure
- Tube (8 shot) - feed new bullet from tube after each shot
- External magazine - feed new bullets
- Hopper - gravity feed around 50 musket balls into weapon (excludes top rail) 
- Top rail 
- Under rail

# Ballistic (Gunpowder)

![Muzzle Loader](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f2/EdoJapaneseArquebuse.jpg)
## Muzzle Loader
Loaded through the muzzle and by default smootheboar and match lock, these firearms are the most ubiquitous around the world due to their crude design and construction.

**Mods**
- Rifling - Increased accuracy and range.
- Second barrel - Double weight and reload time, two shots
- Third barrel - Triple weight and reload time, three shots
- Top rail
- Under rail
- Flint lock

![Revolver](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/df/Colt_Navy_Model_1851.JPG)
## Revolving rifle
A rotating cylinder holds 6 cartridges fired with percussion caps through a rifled barrel.

**Mods**
- 10-round cylinder - Added weight, more shots before reload
- 20-round cylinder - Added weight and bulk, more ammo before reload.
- Top rail
- Under rail


![Turret Revolver](https://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Capture-660x283.png)
## Turret revolver rifle
A rifle with a cylinder that sits horizontally atop the gun and rotates around the vertical axis.

## Europan Pistol (ER-1)
Fed from an external box magazine, the Europan pistol uses smokeless powder to deliver aa pistol-caliber round down-range. The ability to fire seven times combined with the ease of reloading made the weapon a must-have as a backup as well as a primary weapon for non-combat roles.

## Europan submachine gun (ER-31)
Providing automatic fire for sweeping trenches and suppressing the enemy was the main goal of this weapon. Wielding pistol-caliber rounds, the weapon proved itself in eliminating goblins efficiently.


# Explosive

# Caster
Casting devices operate by the mechanics of directing the flow of mana (either from the wielder or a built-in reserve) through a spell crystal, casting a spell. More advanced casters will contain multiple crystals that allow multiple spells as well as more complex ones.

## Caster Ring
The simplest of all casting devices, the caster ring is made from a band of mana steel with an inset mana crystal. A trained wearer with a soul can direct their mana into the ring and cast the crystal's spell. Unless wielded by mages, caster rings are typically used for simple, cheap spells such as producing heat, light, or electricity. On a mage's finger, however, caster rings can channel a vast amount of unfocused energy into very precise spells such as laser beams, lightning bolts, or fine telekenises. 

**Mods**
- Thick band- adds weight, but improves mana efficiency
- Spell crystal slot
- Inset soul stones to provide mana reserve

## Caster Wand
With more room for expansion than a ring, a wand often routes mana through a mana steel core to an embedded soul crystal at the business end.

**Mods**
- Soul stone inset for mana reserve
- Spell crystal slot

## Caster Rifle
Wielded at the shoulder, a caster rifle primarily serves industrial and military purposes. In an industrial capacity, caster rifles can drive nails/spikes, levitate or push heavy objects, and serve as a spot light.

## Caster Cannon
Fundamentally a scaled-up caster rifle, caster cannons often command either hundreds of smaller mana cells, or a few large ones to do their work. The scale of these dictates these devices are either mounted to tripods or vehicles capable of handling their weight. Whilst spell crystals of grand scale do exist, most caster cannons utilize many similar crystals in series. Consequently, canons have very different uses.

**Light Beam Cluster**
A cannon can focus many small beams on a single point, hitting it at the speed of light. This is primarily useful for shooting down high-flying airborne targets that are either out of ballistic cannon range, or can easily evade such a projectile most often.

**Shield Sphere**
Artillery and concentrated fire on an area can be devestating, which is why the shield dome comes in handy in any major defensive structure. A spherical wall of force creates an air-tight bubble that can detonate explosive charges at a safe distance, or otherwise rob kinetic weapons of their potency. These devices can also be used under water, in other realms, or in space to create pressure chambers to fill with atmosphere. A shield sphere surrounding an aircraft can be pumped to vaccum and then filled with a light gas, creating a balloon that can survive being punctured temporarily by projectiles.

**Repulsor**
A caster rifle can jolt a spike into a railroad tie. A repulsor, however, can throw a train. Airships rely primarily upon these devices to keep afloat, and just about every hover vehicle's chassis is built around a repulsor to propel it. Repulsors made for levitation generally incorporate materials from the Ice Realm that have anti-gravity properties, raising material costs by an order of magnitude whilst lowering mana consumption dramatically.

**Actuator Motor**
With significant effort of computers and computors alike, an actuator motor can hold a chassis together by integrity fields alone. Where the actuator motor differs from a repulsor is in the fine accuracy with which it performs. In the simplest case, an actuator motor turns a flywheel and that torque can be used elsewhere to propel a wheeled or tracked vehicle. On the farther scale of complexity, an actuator motor can assemble a chassis from available materials, constructing a many-legged vehicle as it moves. Provided a robust mana supply, such an improvised vehicle can take severe damage and simply reform using the broken exterior components. The same independent actuations that comprise its integrity fields can be used to launch projectiles. It's important to note that actuator motors consume insane quantities of mana.

**Flesh Tank**
Employing biological magics, a flesh tank can heal the critically wounded as well as it can transform one living thing into another through flesh craft. Such a device requires a source of intelligence posessing knowledge of flesh craft, and so very few exist.

**Collector**
Armed with a battery of energy conversion spell crystals, a collector syphens one or more forms of energy into mana. Placed in direct sunlight, beside a furnace, surrounding nuclear fuel rods, or simply in a crowded venue, collectors account for the majority of industrial mana production. Collectors are almost always connected to mana banks.

**Mana Bank**
Massive storage structures capable of transferring their contents, mana banks are often used in large structures and vehicles that tend to consume mana faster than it is produced.
