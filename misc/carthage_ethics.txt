Carthage and its proprietors receive their fair share of criticsm. Wheat farmers driven out of business
by the low price of Carthage wheat oft lob these critisms with blind anger. "How could you do this to us?"
They say. Easily. On your farm you broke your back to till the soil under a baking sun. After the harvests, 
your expensive wheat barely covered your expenses. The families that ate this wheat paid the high price with
money otherwise spent on clothing, medicine, or rainy day money. Now that cheap flour has come to your land,
these families work jobs for Carthage. From a single shift in a Carthage factory a father can feed his family
bread for a week. The children can go to school and the mother can enjoy a well-deserved break from her constant
parenting to relax, or pick up a half-shift to afford luxuries that were previously unknown. That demand for 
luxuries opens new factories, and soon even the unemployed farmer can find work with higher pay and fewer hours.
