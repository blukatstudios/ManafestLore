CLASSIFIED- TOP SECRET

Our test has concluded successfully. Of the fifty force shields containing the
blast, only two remained intact after detonation of the device. By our
estimations, a blast in close proximity should be sufficient to collapse the
force shield of a divine. The heat produced by the detonation was too great for
our sensors to record. It is recommended that this device should only be
deployed at a distance of, at minimum, two leagues from a civilian population.
