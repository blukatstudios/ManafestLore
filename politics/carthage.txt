  Beginning
Carthage grew off the back of the silver and bronze trade. Though
their population was quaint, their command over commodities made
them a major player economically and politically.

  A divine trade
The introduction of divines piqued the interest of Carthage not so
much in the prospect of reliance upon divine favors, but rather
in capturing the power of the divines to use personally. Realizing
the awesome might of divine warfare and magic, the king of 
Carthage made short work of realizing their limitations.

As it was, the divines could not operate without a vast source of
mana. The difficult and unreliable nature of competing with other
divines to secure dedicated worshippers framed Carthage's entry into
the mana trade.

  Profit
Carthage's royalty diverted their riches into the procurement and
study of magical resources and resources from other realms.
Steady investment in arising technologies gave rise to the mana
cell, the industrial-scale spell crystal, soul circutry, and the 
large range of inventions composed of these three elements. To begin
their mana trade, carthage distributed arcane jewelry that harvested
and stored the mana from its wearer. The wearer would wear a 
necklace, bracelet, or hair piece until the indicator light on it
changed from red to green, at which point they would exchange their
jewelry for a new piece in a Carthage store along with a small 
stipend. Naturally the trend of supplementing one's income by 
wearing fancy jewelry caught on and created a steady source of mana
with which Carthage could leverage contracts with the divines.
With the addition of wireless mana transfer, carthage almost entirely
cut their transit expenses. A network of relay stations carried 
a powerful current of mana flowing directly to storage facilities.

  The Ivory Tower
Drastic measures were employed to preserve the proprietary secrets
of these technologies, resulting in Carthage's ivory tower. This
structure was built with a mana cell stashed in each of its millions
of bricks. Wired to a central power core, this tower was used as both
the central storage point as well as a headquarters for Carthage's
wealth elite. The structure, itself, was too weak to maintain its
roughly 3 miles of height. Lacking material science to create such
a structure, Carthage scientists incorporated spell crystals 
continuously casting a force partially canceling out gravity. The 
same crystals maintained an airtight seal between the bricks past the
altitude at which air thins. Rather than construct storage facilities
that could be secured by a military incursion, carthage built a
series of portals at the very top of the structure. Some portals
connected to stable realms, whilst others connected to pocket-realms
maintained by arcane machinery and a constant source of mana. 

  Portal trade fleet.
Using a cycle of outward-facing portals, Carthage was capable of
near-instant transportation of goods and people between distant
locations across the world. Rather than risking the possibility
of such a network to be captured and used against them, Carthage
once again invested in the same pocket-realms housing the scientists
and equipment connected to the Ivory Tower. Further security was
afforded by the construction of flying fortresses suspended in the
air by the same technology holding the Ivory Tower up. By maintaining
the fleet at regular distances, smaller flying vessels were used to
maintain shifting supply chains with with brick and mortar businesses
on the ground. Such a supply made available to the entire world 
perishable and regional resources as well as shortening the distance
of filled mana cells from the source to the Ivory tower.

The mechanized Core-
Rather than raising a massive army of carthegians and spreading it 
thin across the globe, Carthage created a royal navy. Airships fitted
with hangars allowed gliders, planes, and jets alike to deliver 
air support wherever the trde fleet went. For ground conflicts the 
airships carried divisions of Marines piloting advanced magical power
armor. Whilst air strikes could take out large concentrations of
enemies in poor cover, the marines could clear buildings and repel
boarding parties. 

The mercenary meat shield-
On the ground carthage invested in mercenaries to provide a military
presence in highly-accessible frontlines. With a competent mercenary
army available in major trade regions, the trade fleet moved between
pockets of high security. Veteran mercs were largely armed with
caster rifles that had switches for remote deactivation in the event
of mutiny or the operator's death. This gave the otherwise poorly 
trained mercenary units an advantage of firepower that could not
be easily transferred to enemy hands.
