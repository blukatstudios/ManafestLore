Beginning
The Han Empire came into existence far before divine contact. It rose
from the anarchy that punctuated the Qin dynasty, creating the 
compass, gunpowder, papermaking, and printing. 

Divine intervention
The divine of wisdom that greeted the Hans foresaw a population
problem and offered a solution. Many of the craftsmen whose economic
roles relied primarily upon human capital were transformed from 
humans to gnomes. Gnomes, a fraction the height of a human, likewise
consume a fraction of the food and space whilst seeing an improvement
over traditional human craft workers in fine detail due to their
tiny nimble fingers.

Gnome Box
In each city a single plot of land was used to construct a gnome 
box, a structure roughly the size of a house. The gnome boxes 
often featured a new floor every five feet or so, and a large chamber
in the center of the building wherein the gnomes would congregate
to work on larger projects. These gnome boxes served as manufacturing
centers, allowing a small amount of food to feed dozens of workers.

Industrialization
Gnome boxes grew in number, particularly in large cities. In
industrial centers gnome boxes specialized in producing or 
manufacturing particular parts. These industrial centers often 
featured a chain of gnome boxes with raw materials entering one
end and finished products leaving the other. This economy of scale
cheapened the production of many goods such as tools, weapons, paper,
and textiles. Match-lock firearms became a symbol of Han military
might. 

Nationalism
Bolstered by technological superiority over the neighboring warlords,
the Han empire made short work of these regional menaces. To the 
south they invaded Korea. The Han fleet found cannons made all the
difference in naval warfare, making short work of the Japanese navy.
The landlocked Japanese islands were taken with ease, one at a time.
