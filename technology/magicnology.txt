Arcane Material Science

The study of arcane materials has led to a wide range of
advancements not possible with mundane materials alone. What 
separates mundane and arcane materials is the manner in which the
mana particles adhere to physical substance.

Known materials

  Soul Sand
crystals with mana particles suspended inside them. Most soul sand
has inert mana in it, meaning it only distorts the path of mana 
energy that passes through it. Some grains of soul sand, however, 
will display magical behavior when exposed to mana energy. Though
soul sand is often found in fine grains, some naturally-occuring
sources of soul sand are as large as an acorn. Many of these larger
crystals act as a lens, focusing a source of mana energy into a 
small area, and very rarely this results in naturally-occuring spell
crystals that produce a magical spell when connected with a power 
source.

  Soul silver
A form of silver that conducts mana energy. This material is most 
often used as wiring for auto-casting devices and mana computers. 
Soul silver, however, will disperse the mana energy projected from
a magician using ranged magic. This means that spells such as 
telepathy, telekinesis, and mana drain can be hindered or prevented
by soul silver armor or walls containing soul silver dust.

  Soul Stone
A grey rock that mana cannot pass through. This is an ideal material
for weapons made to combat spirits, as one can cut and penetrate
souls using soul stone blades and projectiles. A darker use is the
construction of soul stone containers to store souls in. Provided a
hairline soul silver wire, the souls trapped inside can be be used
to temporarily store mana energy. Provided the container is 
tightly sealed, a soul fresh from a body can be stored without
significant deterioration.

Devices

  Mana Cell
A soul trapped in a cage of soul stone with at least one soul silver
line by which mana can be pumped in or drained out of the vessel.

  Mana Crystal display
An array of spell crystals connecting to insulated 

  Circuit computers
By constructing complex circuits from soul silver, a computer can
perform the same calculation reliably each and every time, provided
it has been painstakenly programmed and debugged to perform said
calculation. Circuit-based computers are most often used to
perform calculations that would be difficult to do precisely by hand. 

  Black Box Computers
A compliant soul can be trained to perform tasks, generally
by associating inputs with outputs. Said computers can be cheaply
and quickly produced due to their simplicity, but are completely
dependent upon the competency of the soul trapped inside.

  Communicators
This device consists of a spell crystal to send telepathic signals
and a spell crystal to receive them. Communicators often use patterns
of pulses that map to letters and numbers to communicate, though some
communicators connected directly to computers send streams of 
high-frequency pulses. A computer is needed to encode and decode
these signals into binary data, and then into human-readable 
datatypes.

  Collectors
A collector consits of a large tank filled with souls and two soul
silver lines. One line is wired to a large mana-draining spell crystal
whilst the other outputs mana energy to power mana devices. A collector
is a useful way to power utility devices in densly populated locations
such as cities, farms, and volcanic areas.

  Caster Rings
A mage that can control their flow of mana energy can use a caster
ring. They simply charge up a burst of mana energy as they would
to cast any spell. Instead of manually casting the spell, however,
they send the mana through the ring and let the crystal inside direct
the energy in a particular structure.

  Auto-Caster Rifles/staves/Blasters
Non-magicians use Auto-casters to combat mages. The simplest of such 
devices consists of mana cells(trapped souls), wired through a 
trigger to a spell crystal. More complex designs involve multiple
spell crystals and quick-release mana cells that can supply short
bursts of mana energy for spells such as light beams.

  Phylactery Suit
Some wishing to remain in the overworld long after physical death
do so by willingly trapping their healthy souls in specially designed
mana cell. Such a cell connects to an additional power source as 
well as actuators for the suit. The user can move the body at will
by directing mana energy to them.
