<h1>Magicnology</h1>
Officially known as applied magic, magicnology consists of additions
made to mundane technological epochs as well as some unique epochs
relying completely on mana.

<h4>Fae dust</h4>
<div>
Produced by grinding fae bones, fae dust is not only a potent source
of mana, but is a potent cure-all for crops. Sprinkling fae dust
onto plants heals them from damage and disease, accelerates 
their growth, and kills most parasites.
</div>

<h2>Epoch: Stone Age</h2>
Due to the limited reach of stone age technolgies, the arcane
arts replaces tech in most applications. The exceptions include
starting fires using energy manipulation or using force
manipulation to shape mud, clay, flint, or stone.

<h2>Epoch: Metal Age</h2>
The metal age opened doors to primitive arcane material science.

<h4>Dragon Bones</h4>
<div>
A benefit of expeditions to the ice realm was the availability of dragon skeletons.
The bones of dragons are so thoroughly permeated with mana that they can be
fashioned into blades or projectiles capable of damaging souls. 
Because mind and soul magic cannot penetrate through dragon bone, bone armor
and walls were developed to combat mages.
</div>

<h4>Caster Ring</h4>
<div>
Expeditions to the ice realm also led to the discovery of soul dust, a substance
that can be compressed under great heat to form spell crystals. Spell crystals 
warp the flow of mana as it passes through, much like a mage does when they cast
a spell. Though most spell crystals aren't well-enough ordered to cast a spell
when supplied with mana, a rare few do. These are affixed to rings and worn by
mages to expand their selection of spells.
</div>

<h2>Epoch: Steam Age</h2>

<h4>Mana Cell</h4>
<div>
Soul metal was discovered in the ice realm, but its application only became
apparent with the invention of the mana cell. Stuffing a small animal such as
a cricket or mouse into a small dragon bone container traps the soul of the
animal inside even after the animal's death. By driving a nail of soul metal
into the bone vessel, a mage can both store and draw mana from this cell.
</div>
<div>
The storage of mana allows its purchase and sale like any commodity. Mana bankers
utilize larger mana cells made with livestock and criminals convicted to the death
sentence in order to facilitate such exchanges. Customers either sell their
mana by discharging their cells or buy it by charging their cells. Wearing small
mana cells as jewelry serves as a source of passive income for non-mages who
otherwise don't benefit from their soul's production of mana.
</div>

<h4>Auto caster</h4>
Connecting a mana cell to a charged spell crystal causes the crystal's spell to
cast until the cell is drained of excess mana. More complex circuitry and 
machining of auto casters allows for a wide variety of uses, some more mana-hungry
than others.
<div>
<ul>
<li>Flameless lamps</li>
<li>Caster rifles that cast damaging spells</li>
<li>Mana heating/cooling/refridgeration</li>
<li>Mana air pumps for pneumatic machines</li>
<li>Mana-propelled carriages</li>
<li>Mana-propelled aircraft</li>
<li>Caster saws/hammers/drills</li>
<li>Caster molds that shape liquid metal</li>
<li>Stationary force shields that protect against ranged ballistic weapons</li>
<li>Mana catapults</li>
<li>Integrity fields to reinforce architecture</li>
<li>Mana communicators</li>
<li>Mana speaker</li>
<li>Mana generators powered by heat/light/motion</li>
</ul>

<h2>Epoch: Data Age</h2>
Building off the circuitry found in the first Auto Casters, mana computers were
born. Networks of communicator-equipped computers and mages allowed for the
near-instantaneous transfer of information across the overworld, and even between
some realms. 

<h4>Soul computor</h4>
<div>
Wiring up a mana cell directly to a communicator allows telepathic
links to be established with the contained soul. They additionally
can access whatever other magic devices are directly wired to their
mana cell. Very occasionally the living will volunteer to live on
as mana computers when their bodies die, effectively becoming
immortal.
</div>

<h4>Circuit computer</h4>
<div>
More complex mana circuitry and components allow for millions of 
logical operations to take place within a second. For repetitive
tasks with consistency or speed as a priority, computers flourish.
Two communicators can, for instance, send encoded messages far
faster than natural language passing through a similar telepathic
link. This enables bulk data transfer. 
</div>

<h4>Data tape</h4>
<div>
The computer reads and writes magnetic patterns onto a spool of 
magnetic tape. It's slow to seek a specific segment of the tape, but
can store volumes of data in a relatively small space. Data tape
ranges in shape and size. Data archives often take up spools that
weigh as much as livestock whilst volumes of music can be stored
on pocket-sized tape cartridges.
</div>

<h4>phylactery Suits</h4>
<div>
Instead of becoming a computor, some opt for a mechanical body they can
control. Some powerful mages can make and control their own phylactery suits
from within a soul cell with a crack or small opening. 
Most others, however, interact with an impressive number of soul
cells using a mesh of soul circuitry. In addition to force crystals
giving basic locomotion, some crystals send sensations of light,
touch, and sound to the trapped soul. Phylactery suits are very
popular in military applications, as with a strong enough mana
supply they can be outfitted with devestating firepower and armor
without the frailty of a human operator. The exorbitant cost of
the suits places them outside the budget of wealthy individuals
and organizations.
</div>



<h4>The Web</h4>
<div>
Circuit computers dedicated to forwarding data form a network
of internconnected machines called the web. Live broadcasts,
web sites, file transfers, and even telepathic links can be
established accross the web. 
</div>

<h4>Data centers</h4>
<div>
Most major libraries have been enhanced with circuit computers
and industrial grade telepathic signal boosters capable of
reaching other devices in a several dozen mile radius. Such locations
are considered data centers. Whilst books are still lent, a steady
effort has been made to transcribe all books into digital 
text and image files stored on reels of magnetic tape. Books on 
tape can be sent on request to any computer on the web. 
Some data centers offer rooms of terminals where customers can pay
to access local collections and the web if they don't own their own
computer. Most data centers offer printing services for arbitrary
text or image files. This allows a book to be uploaded to the web,
and then in under a day to exist in hundreds of libraries accross
the world.
</div>

<h4>The dark web</h4>
<div>
Most data transfer and lookup is deferred to circuit computers.
These devices, unlike souls, are subject to viruses. Connected
to the web, viruses inevitably get past security measures and
compromise systems. When caught, system restores clean the devices.
In a select few cases, however, these viruses are not noticed.
These infected devices comrpise the dark net, a shadow network of
machines that communicate clandestinely, spreading viruses and
accessing hidden files. The dark web is a public secret, a problem
for which no obvious solution exists, and so apathy preserves it
and countermeasures advance one incident at a time. Fortunately,
the viruses that sustain the dark web have no effect on soul computers,
which can't read machine language in the first place.
</div>

<h4>Telepathic Matrix</h4>
<div>
When two telepaths join their consciousnesses, they form a shared
lucid dream. Non-mages can use autocasters and the Web to accomplish
this same task on a much larger scale with hundreds of concurrent
minds joined at once. The rules are simply that the minds aware of
a particular action have to accept it for it to occur in the 
the Matrix. Whilst able-bodied mortals may freely use the
Matrix, the computors see it as a personal realm where they can
exist as their most preferred form and interact with others as
if they still had bodies.
</div>

<h4>The virus</h4>
<div></div>

<h2>Epoch: Portal Age</h2>
<div>
By converting atomic power to mana, the continual use of portals
became possible.
</div>

<h4>Pocket realms</h4>
<div>
Though space on the overworld is abundand, security is not.
Pocket realms are realms created through the powerful application
of mana. Whilst they require upkeep to prevent collapse, they
cannot be accessed without a portal. It is possible to maintain
a pocket realm for hundreds of years by leaving a nuclear reactor
powering the necessary machinery to keep it from collapsing. Not
only are these locations inaccessible to those without portal
magic, but they are inaccessible to anyone lacking the specific
portal spell that leads to the pocket realm.
</div>

<h4>Portal Nexus</h4>
<div>
A portal nexus is a physical location where multiple portals lead.
Whilst very few portals are open constantly, many will share the
same end point on a regular schedule. As such, a large number of
connections can be maintained whilst only having to power on a
handful of connections at any one time.
</div>

<h4>Space travel</h4>
<div>
Many of the difficulties of space travel can be overcome by
nuclear power funneling through the appropriate magic devices.
In addition to force fields, heating/cooling, EM fields, 
portals play a vital role in life support. 
Ventilating the interior of a space vessel allows it to have a
constant source of fresh air. In addition, that same portal 
to the overworld can be used to cycle out personnel in order 
to render living quarters completely optional in ship design.
