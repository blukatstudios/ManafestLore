<h1>History</h1>
<h2>Arcane Birth</h2>
The Persian Empire spread NorthEast of the Mediteranian where it seized a 
permanent foothold. A faction of dreamers seeking asylum from the civil war
in the dream realm brought the knowledge of arcane magic to the Persians.

After an initial pool of mages were trained, the benefits became immediately
clear. Flames could be produced without fuel, enormous slabs of stone could
be carved and lifted by small teams without tools. On the battlefield boulders
were lobbed at enemy armies and force shields blocked incoming arrows. The
spread of the arcane arts in Persia led to an industrial revolution without
leaving the bronze age.

<h2>Divine Wars</h2>
When the divines came to overtake Persia, they were met with a warm reception.
The divines demonstrated the equivalent magic of an army of mages, but offered
it in exchange for allegience and mana-draining prayers. Powerless without a 
source of mana, the divines skipped over Persia in their initial settling. 

Throughout the warring in Europa Persia remained powerful enough to hold back
any orc attacks, but not did not inspire enough fear from the divines to prompt 
the sort of direct attacks Europa experienced.
