The C alphabet contains 32 characters.

Words are broken up into bytes.
Half of each byte is one of the 16 consonants,
and the other half is a vowel or decorator.

sh (1111) is a silent consonant that is coupled with decorators to end a
sentence and modify it. Modified sentences have different inflection and
provide the words inside a specific context.

A sentence "buy shoe" becomes an offer when spoken with request inflection.
A respondant can then repeat the sentence, either with fulfill inflection to
answer in the affirmative, or with final inflection to completely dismiss the request.

The language is written and read top to bottom, and then left to right.

Example sentences could look like this (No dictionary exists; no words exist.)
04       (wah)
E0 63 97 (meh fee ju)
F9  (<=)
(buy shoe?)

04       (wah)
E0 63 97 (meh fee ju)
FE  (><)
(No buy shoe)
