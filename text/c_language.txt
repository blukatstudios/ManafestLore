As Carthage grew its trade networks and extended citizenship to an increasingly diverse
population, encountered communications issues it had not previously known. The C language
was constructed as a minimalist language to unite all peoples under Carthage culture.

Any citizen of any first language could feasibly memorize the majority of the language's 
255 words and symbols in a semester of night classes. Translating between two languages 
became an issue of translating from native language A to C, then from C to language B.
Many natives thus became translators and transcribers for their trading posts.

When the language reached paperwork and computers, it showed its second efficiency. 
Given 255 possible symbols, a square footprint for each character ensured that 
sentences took up a minimum of ink and paper. Producing stamps and presses for these
symbols made use of the printing press far less laborious in regions lacking computer
access. In regions with computers, each symbol was expressed as a single byte. Even with
the language's restricted vocabulary requiring multiple general words in place of a single
specific word, the language proved most compact.
