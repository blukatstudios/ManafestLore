Some seek to own the world. Most others seek smaller things. Cities, villages, farms, or homes
await ownership. But what does it mean to own any of these things?
 
Perfect ownership is characterized by two properties:
1. One exercises autonomy over that which is owned.
2. One prevents others from doing the same.

A king claims, by royal decree, that he owns a forest. The authorities know to apprehend anyone
found trespassing. However, since the land is vast and uninhabited, the royal guard seldom if
ever steps foot in the forest. 

Peasants, ignoring the royal decree in favor of their own interests, move in. They cut
a clearing and build a small village there. Whilst they know they are hidden from the king
and his soldiers, they likewise know they could not hope to defend themselves if discovered.

Who owns this land? A Roman soldier would undoubtedly claim the authority of the king takes precedence. A Han farmer would hold fast to the principle that the 
land belongs to those which better it. I hope to impress upon you that both of these answers are prescriptive, an attempt to tell the world how it should behave. 
Regardless of the moral truth of this issue, the world will only abide by its own rules. A scholar of Carthage will describe the precariousness of this
situation in terms of its reasoned consequences.

Carthage is not without its moral sensibilities, but it proudly displays only two principles: stability and growth. 

The naive prescribe stability via a careful balance of altruism and self interest. What this perspective misses is the distinction between purposeful altruism and the
pursuit of a clear conscience. One can give a beggar a coin or meal and feel satisfied they've genuinely helped. They won't follow the pathetic creature to learn that
it receives most of its meals this way. Thus a beggar is a parasite that only consumes. Of the gifts you can give a beggar, a paying job is the most kind. For a beggar
that can clothe, house, and feed himself is hardly a beggar anymore. Cutting parasites off from ill-gotten gains is the very nature of stability, as there is nothing
more unsustainable than the free lunch. As for growth, consider the beggar given a loaf of bread beside the beggar given a job. In a year's time, one has paid off his
debts and built a financial cushion. The other hungers and begs. One can convert their own resources into capital as investment in a business or training for a trade.
The other can grow more pathetic in hopes of earning more pity.

There are two kinds of growth. Firstly, there is the acquisition of new resources. Secondly, there is the greater utilization of existing resources. Resources that
are completely unutilized might as well not exist. For this reason, the peasants that sneak into the king's unused forest are, in essence, discovering new land. They
clear a field, pull stumps, and grow crops. They plant, harvest, and increase next year's grain yields. They are like the beggar that has gained a job, increasing value
on a daily basis. The forest left dormant to the king, however, runs at a deficit, as the political influence to keep the forest empty is by no means free.

And so let us advance the time scale of our two sets of alternatives. A beggar with a job grows to be a most-humble merchant, and the forest turns to new fields and homes. 
The beggar gifted bread still takes what he can get, and the king's forest left unsettled merely brims with untapped potential the way it had a millenium before.
The king might then claim some right to the land, and by his law he is correct. However, carthagean scholars are concerned with the consequences of any given action.

Here we have a situation of imperfect ownership of a property. The king exercises autonomy over the land in that he intentionally does nothing with it. He fails to
prevent the peasants from moving onto it by ignorance. The peasants that live on the land exercise their own autonomy over the land by developing it. They cannot,
however, prevent the king from expelling them by anything aside from the accident of his ignorance. This leads us to the heart of the gnarled, knotted root of our
moral dilemma as Carthageans looking onto the world. Two absolutist positions arise.

The first school sees the violation of the king's legal property rights as a crime. Wealth born from crime is thus tainted wealth, and so this tainted wealth
taints the properties of ownership the peasants have over the village they created. The king is right to expell them in this case, and is entitled to some or
all of the wrongly accrued wealth. The damage the peasants have done is damage to the legal foundation of property rights that not only give us motive to
acquire wealth that we know will be protected, but offers economic stability by preventing sudden violations of autonomy in shifting property. 

The second school sees a fallow forest that profits no party converted to a village that generates trade for its neighbors. Even as this village dodges
taxes to the king, it builds the economy of its neighbors, which in turn provide more taxes than otherwise. After being discovered, the king gains most 
by taxing the village instead of destroying it. If the king wishes to vacate the forest, then he must do so on the terms of the forest's functional 
owners who have maintained and grown the value of the property. The king is forced to think long and hard about the land he arbitrarily claims for 
himself, either dedicating more troops to each vacant property, or merely allowing the land to become common when occupied. If the two were to
come to arms against one another over the property, they would have equal rights in the fight. The king has legitimate original ownership of the land,
whilst the peasants have built up ownership of the derived value of the land. The peasants steal the land when they stay, and the king steals the
value created when he kicks them out. When both parties are in the wrong, the consequences must be the root.

As you may have figured, the king with guarded vacant forests will spend his troops guarding those forests. The king who spends those same troops collecting 
taxes from forest villages will have enough resources left over to invade that first kingdom and occupy it. Whether right or wrong, fluid property rights
are beneficial to all involved.
