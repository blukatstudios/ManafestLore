Some seek to own the world. Most others seek smaller things. Cities, villages, farms, or homes
await ownership. But what does it mean to own any of these things?
 
Perfect ownership is characterized by two properties:
1. One exercises autonomy over that which is owned.
2. One prevents others from doing the same.

A king claims, by royal decree, that he owns a forest. The authorities know to apprehend anyone
found trespassing. However, since the land is vast and uninhabited, the royal guard seldom if
ever steps foot in the forest. 

Peasants, ignoring the royal decree in favor of their own interests, move in. They cut
a clearing and build a small village there. Whilst they know they are hidden from the king
and his soldiers, they likewise know they could not hope to defend themselves if discovered.

Who owns this land? A Roman soldier would undoubtedly claim the authority of the king takes precedence. A Han farmer would hold fast to the principle that the 
land belongs to those which better it. I hope to impress upon you that both of these answers are prescriptive, an attempt to tell the world how it should behave. 
Regardless of the moral truth of this issue, the world will only abide by its own rules. A scholar of Carthage will describe the precariousness of this
situation in terms of its reasoned consequences.

Carthage is not without its moral sensibilities, but it proudly displays only two principles: stability and growth. 

The naive prescribe stability via a careful balance of altruism and self interest. What this perspective misses is the distinction between purposeful altruism and the
pursuit of a clear conscience. One can give a beggar a coin or meal and feel satisfied they've genuinely helped. They won't follow the pathetic creature to learn that
it receives most of its meals this way. Thus a beggar is a parasite that only consumes. Of the gifts you can give a beggar, a paying job is the most kind. For a beggar
that can clothe, house, and feed himself is hardly a beggar anymore. Cutting parasites off from ill-gotten gains is the very nature of stability, as there is nothing
more unsustainable than the free lunch. As for groth, consider the beggar given a loaf of bread beside the beggar given a job. In a year's time, one has paid off his
debts and built a financial cushion. The other hungers, and begs. One can convert their own resources into capital as investment in a business or training for a trade.
The other can grow more pathetic in hopes of earning more pity.

There are two kinds of growth. Firstly, there is the acquisition of new resources, and secondly there is the greater utilization of existing resources. Resources that
are completely unitilized might as well not exist. For this reason, the peasants that sneak into the king's unused forest are, in essence, discovering new land. They
clear a field, pull stumps, and grow crops. They plant, harvest, and increase next year's grain yields. They are like the beggar that has gained a job, increasing value
on a daily basis. The forest left dormant to the king, however, runs at a deficit, as the political influence to keep the forest empty is by no means free.

And so let us advance the time scale of our two sets of alternatives. A beggar with a job grows to be a most-humble merchant, and the forest turns to new fields and homes. The
beggar gifted bread still takes what he can get, and the king's forest left unsettled merely brims with untapped potential the way it had a millenium before.
