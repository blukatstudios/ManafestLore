Today, they say,
we'll pave the way
to a world connected
and cities erected,
to peace abroad.
And we'll applaud.
Yes, we'll laud the fraud.

They'll lead us to cages,
both fools and the sages.

The lack of steel,
is the main appeal, 
and yet we'll feel
bindings most surreal.

Without a wall, 
they'll contain us all.

Don't believe me? Try to run.
And once you've begun
you'll hear it.
The rattling of your chains,
and what remains
of your ragged breath.
From cradle to death.
You're theirs now.

You are a cog, a wheel,
a loyal dog, 
a well traned seal.

Today, I say,
please turn away
from a world most grim
and futures slim,
from our masters abroad.
When winter's ice is thawed.
We won't find ourselves their yaude.
