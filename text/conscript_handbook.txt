1 Intro
So you've been conscripted. What now?

Now it's time you learn how bad things really are, and what's at stake. Though we have
consistently repelled the waves of monsters sent by Moros, our economy has been strained
by the unending warfare. We've honed our weapons technology over the years, and have grown
excedingly efficient at facing this known enemy. Each Europan fatality comes at the cost
of one or two thousand enemy soldiers. Even still, our aggressive recruiting just isn't
enough. You likely worked in a factory. Now your wife and kids do. 

2 Equipment

The EU40 weapons platform is the crown jewel of our infantry weapons research. Through modular component design, it can assume the form needed to provide for each role, and repair through replacement of these modules. A soldier can, under short notice, re-configure his rifle to address changes in tactical demands. Though possible combinations of parts range in the millions, the main forms of the EU40 are noted as below.

Marksman rifle
Firing a full rifle round, this configuration traditionally involves heavier and more costly precision components designed not for mobility, but for engaging the enemy accurately and from a great distance. The primary role for a marksman armed is to pick off strategic targets. Secondarily, a marksman provides eyes on the battlefield to direct artillery and air support.

Battle rifle
Firing a full rifle round, this configuration puts out the greatest volume of fire, and the most firepower per shot for mobile soldiers. Frontline soldiers armed with battle rifles use it to fire through cover and armor from outside of bow and spear range. This configuration is chiefly designed for soldiers who must be more mobile than the marksman, but are tasked with bringing down larger monsters.

Support rifle
Generally propped up by a bipod to deliver an intermediate rifle round, this configuration is optimized for volume of fire. A support rifleman may work from a defensive position, or otherwise may provide suppressive fire to create opportunities for friendly advancement. The support rifle, above all else, allows one man to dispatch a hundred charging goblins from a distance.

Storm rifle
The storm rifle offers accuracy at mid range, mobility at close range, and an intermediate rifle round capable of neutralizing other infantry, the storm rifle is ideal for the frontline soldier tasked with clearing goblins out from urban environments.

Personal defense rifle
Chambering a pistol cartridge, the personal defense rifle provides a very light and compact weapon for soldiers tasked with hauling other primary equipment, operating vehicles, or otherwise fighting in close-quarters environments such as policing the interiors of fortresses.

Scattergun
The scattergun fits into the EU40 platform as an under-barrel attachment, which is the original purpose the weapon was mass-produced. It fires shot or a slug through a smoothe barrel, and can fire once before a reload via break action. A secondary stock for the weapon slides in place where an EU40 would otherwise attach to the scattergun, coverting it from an attachment to a standalone weapon that can cheaply arm civilians in the event a fortress wall is breached. Scatterguns frequently include an attached bayonette due to their single shot limitation.
