"Cerro, it's time you learned who we are, where we are."
It was Cerro's tenth birthday, and it was already time for the talk.

"Look out the window. Past the farm. Past the walls. What do you see?"

"The battlefront?"

"Right. And what keeps the battlefront over there, and not over here?"

"The wall does."

Cerro's father looked down to him scoldingly. "Not in the least. Some rope and rocks are all it'd
take for goblins to get over. The orcs wouldn't even need that much. They'd just
keep pounding and pounding until the cement crumbled. Demons would just scale it. Try agian."

"The soldiers?"

The man unslung the rifle from his back and held it for Cerro to look over. It was a carbine, 
a pistol save for the stock and the barrel. Cerro's father inspected the weapon, running his
fingers across the muzzle and lever. He then thrust the long-arm into his son's arms.

"We are. You need to understand that you are a citizen. Every citizen is expected to pull his
or her weight, volunteer when there are opportunities, and to defend Europa from threats foreign
and domestic. Some day these walls may be crowded with citizens repelling monsters. You may be
among them."

Cerro inspected the weapon with wide eyes. When he turned his gaze up to his father, he saw
the man's eyes wet.

"Son, this is your rifle now. Keep it with you always. You never know when you will need it."

"But it's yours, dad."

Cerro attempted to hand the weapon back and a hand stopped him.

"It's yours now. There was a draft, and I've been issued a service rifle. We'll be deployed to the coast tomorrow."

The two stood in silence, listening to the wind passing through the swaying waves of
wheat. Chickens clucked, cows mooed, and a bee buzzed through one open window and out another
in its search for a flower. 



Four years passed. The bees still buzzed. The wall still stood.
In its shadow, rows of stones stood as well. They were a recent addition.
More soldiers were needed.



"What are you?"

"Scum, sir."

The drill officer's grimmace intensified. He growled.
"You are the lower than scum. You are the worthless refuse that scum exudes.
You are the caustic substance that grows on cement and slowly consumes it.
Drop and give me twenty."

At the fourth push-up, Cerro felt a boot between his shoulder blades. It pressed
down. 

"Keep it coming. Or do you want to go home to your cows and chickens?"

Cerro could only afford a fourth of a breath on his weak wheeze of a reply.

"No sir."


And so his training continued.

"The EU40 is the only thing separating us from the apes.
With one pull of the trigger and sweep of the muzzle, an untrained man can sweep a trench
free of orcs."

The drill officer pulled the charging handle back, let it slap back into place, and then
leveled the beige rifle pointed down range. With a chain of thunder that pounded Cerro's
cotton-plugged ears, the weapon boomed and expended seething brass casings into the air.
Down range a cement model of an orc at first became riddled with holes, but soon crumbled
under its own weight and collapsed into a pile of chunks as the officer emptied the weapon.

"With a skilled operator, the EU40 is a devastating weapon at 120 cubits, clear out of
spear-chucking range."

The magazine fell free from the steaming weapon, and was soon replaced by another. Aiming
with great concentration, the officer fired the rifle once, then again, and a third time.
Each shot was accompanied by a cement orc's head exploding on the opposite end of the range.

"Unworthy as you may be, you lucky ducks will each get the privilege of your very own rifle. 
You will respect it, protect it, and you will worship each and every pin of its countenance.
If you die, you will be replaced swiftly. If your weapon malfunctions in battle, no punitive
action will be taken on the part of your commanding office. The orcs, however, will rip your
arms off, gouge your eyes, and leave you a writhing in agony. If they steal your rifle,
they will cease to be dumb apes, and will subsequently wield this swift and terrible sword."

That day three hundred and ninety recruits became Europan ground soldiers while ten became marksmen.


Four months passed, and these men were only one of five groups of four hundred
introduced to the Western front.
