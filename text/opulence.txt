Portal nexus was closed for thirty seven minutes today after a technician
left the door to a mobile animal pen open and unsupervised for over an hour.
The giraffes inside quickly escaped and became spooked as panick broke out
in the terminal.

Ping Lu, who was taking his first ride on a nexus train told reporters. 
"We couldn't believe what we were seeing. The giraffes came stampeding
through the portal and we all ran for shelter. One man didn't make it."

The native Constantinople man who is yet to be identified, was trampled
by multiple stampeding giraffes. He has since been taken to the local
Life facility and no further details have been reported.

The technician responsible for this giraffe gaffe has been found and
sentenced to one season of The Arena with Hasdrubal while wearing a 
giraffe costume. Don't miss Season 11 early next year, where we will
find out how he fares.
