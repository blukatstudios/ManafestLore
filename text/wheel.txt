The spokes of the great wheel turn,
and so too we are bound to endless motion.

The Eastern horizon bears a star greater than the others.
Its burning red rushes forth to split the night's pale darkness.
Guided by this light, man sups upon the Grandfather Sun's blessing of birth.

Rich, golden rays soak the plains to their core until every creature within them stirs.
Calling out for the first time, man names the many things he sees in the growing light.
He calls himself master of the wealth before him, and so he strays Grandfather Sun.

The Western horizon bears a familiar gold that fades to red, and finally black.
Birdsong and chirping insects give way to the rustling of fallen leaves.
Man holds onto his lost light throughout the dark.

Grandfather Sun's light grows dim and the world is blanketed in cold.
White is man's breath, as is his fair and the land beneath his feet.
Man's vision extends from the past to the future, where he sees himself.
He is rising again.

Grandfather sun rises again, and his eyes are man's.
Their crimson gaze pentrates the cold darkness to meet that of a new child.
He looks upon his father, Man, and on his mother, Earth.
He is neither and both.
